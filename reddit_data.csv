2016-01-15,,"Hello,

Without disclosing my actual name, most people to call me Big D. I am taking this class because it sounds intriguing and unlike anything I have ever taken before. My major is in Interdisciplinary Studies, with each concentration being Marketing/Sales and Communication. I am interested in learning about this topic, and how it affects our culture and each person individually. Looking at our culture from the outside, I can say that we as a whole have a fairly sexualized view of women. I believe it has been a gradual effect over the years, and am interested in many aspects that surround this topic. I hope to gain a better understanding throughout the semester so that I can be more knowledgable in the subject and potentially educate those around me.

Anyway, I look forward to our future discussions on the topic.",8018,None,23:49:59

2016-01-20,,"The definition of sex will always remain the same between two organisms (not just humans). There is always an incentive when talking about sex. As stated in the video, many people have sex just for the physical pleasure that it brings, while others try to make children. Regardless of the the reason, humans are naturally drawn together for this purpose which is fascinating. I think sex should be an open topic for discussion (within reason of a person's age/maturity). I believe this from personal experience because my family never got into details with me and I found out what I know through friends or the internet.",8018,None,07:04:49
2016-01-27,,"It's strange to think about how cultures from the past viewed sex. For instance, it was not uncommon for people to be married or even have kids by their early 20's. This is scary for me to think about because I would have no clue on how to handle that at my age. Technology has increased over the years which definitely changes things. Things such as condoms and birth control have helped reduce the risk of pregnancies. If these had been invented and introduced to the public many years ago, they might have been ignored to a degree because of the change in people's views on sex and children.",8018,None,22:04:40

People sometimes have to go through dozens of boyfriends/girlfriends to finally find the right person who they will eventually marry or spend the rest of their life with. This means that there are better odds that the person you are with currently will not be that person. 
While I think it is good that some money is put into taking these pictures off the internet, there will always be people dumb enough to send them out. It should be a top priority to educate the youth about sending out these pictures because it is a lot tougher to recover from something like this when the person is young in their teens.",8018,None,22:14:46

Over the past 10-20 years in my opinion, sex has drastically been shoved in our faces through these means. It's almost like the media wants to normalize sex or introduce it to us at a very young age. I think this falls back on the idea that sex has changed from people just trying to reproduce to pleasure in the 1970's. Personally, I am scared for what is to come in the future through movies and music. When I have children, I am definitely going to have to keep a close eye on what they are watching or listening to.",8018,None,02:20:49

The fact that hotels have to announce they will stop offering porn as a ""moral"" decision is hilarious. These people could care less about that; all they want is our money. Anyway, it still is mind-boggling that people will pay for these services when there is SO MUCH porn that is free. To me that seems really impractical, but I guess to each his own. As for the conversation of women in porn, they will always be degraded because of its very nature. It will never change. The girls that decide to get into the industry are fully aware of what they will be doing and how it will look, so I don't show much sympathy for them.",8018,None,02:28:27
2016-02-01,,"Hey Brittany, good question. I was raised in a Christian household and went to church every Sunday growing up so I can tell you what they believe on the issue of sex. First of all, Christians believe sex outside of marriage is a sin and should never be done. This is very hard to follow if you are a Christian in your teens and young adulthood, and I have had some friends decide to get married very young on what I believe to be mostly because they just want to have sex. This principle has remained the same in the New and Old Testament. The church that I went to discussed sex very rarely, as well as my household too. Most of what I learned about sex was through friends or the internet. Christians also believe masturbating is a sin and should not be committed. While a lot of the Bible is written plainly on what is right and wrong, there are many passages that are up to the readers' interpretation. This is where religion gets confusing (not just Christianity). A great example of this is the topic of homosexuality (which is getting a little off topic so I won't get into details).

The culture around the country has certainly shifted in the past 30 years in a far more liberal way, so I don't see how these results can be the same. Sex has been normalized so much to a point in which the survey claims 80% of people think it is alright to have sex outside of marriage.

Most of the girls have little education and therefore end up ""living in the fast life"" for their short run in the industry and come away with nothing. At least Alix has her degree to fall back on once her run is over, but webcamming and pornography does not look good on a job resume.

Don't force a business to change something because you don't like it or are offended by it. That's simply ridiculous. They are completely within the law here. With that said, there is no doubt in my mind that they are making more money dressing their employees this way, or else they wouldn't be doing it. When the female owner is asked if she would let her daughter do this when she grows up, the answer comes across really half-hearted to me. Honestly though, who cares.

I think the rock in my front yard has a higher IQ then she does. Anyway, when I try to relate Kim to our class, I see somebody who uses sex to prosper financially in life.

One point I would like to bring up is at what age does it make it less awful to see a naked picture of somebody? In different countries around the globe, people get married as early as 12 or 13 years old. But here in the U.S., anyone under the age of 18 is a minor. We struggle with many issues such as teen pregnancy here in America, but in other countries some of their people the same age are already starting careers or families and are not considered minors. In our current culture, it's seen as normal for men to watch porn, but watching anything under the age of 18 is ""perverted."" Is this just a product of our culture in America?

I remember the first time I was exposed to the female body was through internet ads that popped up on my parent's desktop computer. For kids who are quiet like me, they won't tell anybody and will keep things secret. I would always want for my kid to talk to me about anything, but in all honesty they probably won't want to bring this up.

People's morals and values (or lack of) are so screwed up. This is all in my opinion of course, but I think it's something that ties back in with religion.

In this particular case, I'm not exactly sure if she was filmed without consent or if she sent him pictures willingly so I can't comment on that part of it. But I do know many friends of mine from junior high and high school that participated in sending nude photos.

Parents should be the ones who pull the kids aside and teach them about sex and what they want for their son or daughter, whether it be abstinence or safe sex. Obviously, not all parents do this and that's why we have lots of young kids learn about these things through friends or media or whatever else.

2016-04-25,,"Actually, according to a United States Department of Justice report from 2011-2012, only an estimated 4 percent of men from the prison system stated that they had been raped or pressured into any sexual activity in the past year. Some might dispute this number claiming that some men might not report a rape or assault due to pride or other reasons. Even so, if we bump this number up to 10 or 15 percent, that number is still relatively small, and definitely does NOT constitute a statement such as ""it""s common sense that men are raped all the time in jail."" As for a ""public outcry"", there isn't one because these men are in jail. They are criminals. I believe that a great deal of people see this as karma if you will. If it really is so miserable in jail with ""men being raped all the time"", then why do over 50 percent of the men who go to jail keep coming back? (source - Bureau of Justice statistics from April 2014). I think inmates have it too easy, but that's just my own opinion. I believe this because of the previous statistic I used above. If jail was so awful, then why do more then half the prison population return to prison a 2nd time? And a 3rd time? I would like to hear what others might think on the topic.",8018,None,07:00:16
2016-04-25,,"Please re-read my statement above, Mascot80. I never said that rape is okay or justifiable. I said that many people are not up in arms about the VERY SMALL 4 percent of men that are raped or forced into sexual activity in prison. If you took a poll, I don't think many people would feel too upset if a child molestor or a murderer is raped in prison. 
In regards to why you think people are returning to jail, I have to disagree with you. You said ""we don't really reform people in jail we merely punish them."" This is not true. There is SO much available to inmates, including libraries with tons of books to help them learn new things and keep their minds sharp. There have been many cases of inmates learning to read and write inside prisons, or even cases of inmates getting their GEDs. There are even classes available to inmates such as woodshop or painting. So there are actually many many tools available to help reform inmates.
As for your 1st comment, I agree that it may be hard at first to get used to life outside of the prison system. But it is not anything that anyone can't handle. This is America for Christ's sake. SOMEBODY out there will hire you, even if you have to start at McDonalds or Burger King. People choose the path they desire, and much of the time for these inmates, it's the same old story such as selling drugs or whatever it was that got them into prison in the first place. You have free will to choose, so I feel nothing at all towards these repeat offenders who choose to live a life of crime rather then being a working part of society.

They didn't say you have to get naked or film some sort of sexual video for them. The CEO just wants applicants to answer one simple question: How do you make others happy? When I try to break down the barriers of why a porn website would offer a scholarship for college applicants, the answer is simple: positive public perception. This is in my mind a publicity stunt, to reshape how people might think of the website and what it does. When you get down to the bottom of it, it doesn't really matter what anybody thinks about this, because they are promoting a college scholarship and that's what it comes down to.

That isn't just some chump change, but a serious amount of cash for a sex toy. They are still years and years away from making something like this affordable to most people, so I wouldn't freak out at that aspect quite yet. What I would be worrying about is the fact that you can personalize them to look like anyone you want for an extra fee. I'm sure they have or will have laws against making these look like children, but even with adults I still believe there will be some issues that need to be discussed here. I don't know how I feel personally about it. On one hand, I think it is crossing the line to have a sex toy created to look like somebody without them knowing it or without having permission. But on the other hand, I'm not sure if there is a law or anything preventing the makers of these sex dolls from doing this. Maybe these dolls could help lower rape or sexual assault rates, who knows.

My response to this would be this: would somebody consider this object important enough to save up $7000 for? I believe that until they make their way to around or slightly below $1000 will they see a large response from the public. Anyway, going back to the article, it reminded me while reading through this of that Will Smith movie, iRobot. They refer to a robot who may have the capability of cooking and cleaning, as well as sexual desire, and say it may be ready by 2040. I don't want to see a world that comes down to this, where humans start losing jobs to robots who perform these tasks. It has actually already started, though it's still in a very early stage.

2017-07-13,Everything Fucking Sucks,"I hate optimism. All of society is full of shit. Every aspect of life you are supposed to conform and act the part with a smile on the face that its all just gravy and rainbows. It makes me fucking sick.

If you are true to your own nature and it is your understanding that life sucks, society DOES NOT give you that option. When you see friends and family there is a pressure to act the part that life is going well and you are happy and all is great. In school, you are taught to work hard and the efforts will pay off someday. At work you are told to work hard and you might get promoted a shit tier above your current shit tier pay. That is of course if you can secure employment, good luck on that one. 

If you do everything as told, study hard, work hard, etc you are still underpaid, under appreciated, and going nowhere. It's all a scam to keep you keeping on like a good little worker drone. Are you happy yet? You should be! After all, you finally have that mind-numbingly boring 9-5 shit hole to go to everyday. Finding that rewarding, purposeful career is another bullshit illusion that doesn't exist for 99% of jobs out there. Good luck finding that 1% job (if it is even that high).

Many are debt slaves to the system because they believe what society tells them about getting an education. In the end, the education does nothing, you learn nothing of value, and are only left with loans to pay back with your shit job that never required any education to begin with. Oh you can't find a job? You can pay a nice low minimum monthly payment on your student loans and they will grow bigger and bigger with interest. It's really no problem at all ;)

Oh yeah, and even if you do happen to find the job, it will probably suck balls. Doing anything 8 hours per day is a recipe for hating it, and fast. Your job might suck, management might suck, the commute might suck, the pay might suck, the hours might suck, the fact that it's temporary with no benefits, the fact that it is boring and mindless as fuck, the fact that no one wants to recognize talent and help you move up to the next level, your coworkers that suck, customers that are morons, time you can't take off, the list goes on and on. If you don't have the job, you are fucked and once you get it you are fucked, but it is just a different kind of fucked.

It's all such bullshit. The dating scene is filled with the same crap, and you're supposed to be happy and show ""your best traits"" to another person/land whale for the most part. Good luck if you're of a negative disposition, don't like people very much because of the shit that society has done to you. 95% of girls will want nothing to do with you cause you're such a downer. Cue loneliness and sexual frustrations. WHo wants to be with an unhappy loser? Good luck finding someone else who also understands how much everything sucks and isn't brainwashed like the majority.

And in the end, it's never that life sucks, is it? You go to the doctor because you're unhappy with your shit lot in life, the nothingness and purposelessness that pervades everything around you, and you're told it is ""depression"" and we can help you by giving you happy pills so you can be more like everyone else. Or we can talk to you and try to ""think differently IE cognitive bullshit crap"" so that you have more positive thoughts rather than negative ones...

Therapists are unwilling to accept the fact that life fucking blows. It's just society's way to treat unhappy people because you wouldn't have as much productivity if everyone felt this way. There needs to be methods in place to keep the cogs continually turning. Heaven forbid people should actually find out it's a load of crap and they were onto something before they visited the shrink. The amount of people on meds for their unhappiness should be a strong indication that life sucks and the optimism bias we see all around us is lies.

Luckily there are people who get it. You guys do. Thank goodness there's this as an outlet because outside these walls, a shockingly few amount of people seem to get that it's all a fucking load of crap.",6085,Problem Gambling,21:13:08

2017-07-21,"Depression as a rational reaction, not a disease","To me, depression is not simply a ""mental disease"". It can be a rational reaction to the utter bullshit of life. How can one go through life without getting angry, sad, upset, disappointed, defeated, bored, tired, depressed? This is beyond me. Much of life is filled with DAILY bullshit you do not want to do. I am suggesting that depression can be a natural reaction to the bad parts of life. It is a response to the absurdity of living a pointless life where death is certain to come, with no possible escape. Death which renders everything you do here pointless in a 100 years time. If one is honest with himself, how can the situation not lure him into depression? 

Perhaps the opposite is true, those who do not suffer depression are the ones who are mentally ill. Those sheep who blind themselves to the utter pointlessness of their lives and their bullshit illusions. Normal non depressed people love going to the malls and shopping for shit, feeding the machine of materialism, distracting themselves with any number of lifes stupid distractions and working the corporate slave 9-5 with a smile on their face. Fucking losers. And they'll tell you you're the one with an illness for seeing right through this crap. For thinking about the absurdity of society and reading the works of brilliant philosophers like Schopenhauer who really got it. Its really pathetic the whole thing. 

If you are a deluded worker drone consumer who is happy all the time and spending your work money on pointless, stupid materialistic things you are perfectly fine and normal in our society but if you want to think about your own life itself and the futility of everything we do here, and are miserable being a little slave you are diseased.

""Depression"" is a convenient term they created to lump anyone unhappy with life under the same umbrella and call it a disease. Unhappy people are then ""diseased people"" that need treatment to become more like optimists. Optimists are healthy and productive to society and pessimists are diseased and need help and correction with medications. Clever way for society to say fuck you to unhappy folks and keep people deluded and spending their money while keeping the cogs spinning.

2017-07-24,Society's Lie To The Youth,"Societys big lie to the youth is that you actually have choices you can make.

First off, when we are young we all have to go to school to be brainwashed by our teachers. They will tell us things like, work hard and you can achieve anything you want in life. They will teach us useless information that has absolutely no relevance in the world outside of academics. They will judge you on your ability to conform and parrot back to the the useless information they fed to you. They will never teach you to critically look at your life and all the illusions you believe. Nope, education instead is a way for the system to program you while your young and feed you the lies that if you work hard now, you will live a happy life later. You have no choice but to go to school as a child and be subject to this crap. You do not have the mental facilities to reject what they tell you, so you are programmed to think their way about things. You cannot revolt against the countless tests and homework and useless assignments you will have to complete. No, revolt gets you into trouble and will make things worse for you as a student. 

You are required to go to school. This is not a choice you make, as it is very rare that children can be homeschooled. As you get into high school and beyond, school gives you a false sense of choice. You can choose this or that elective class for the semester. But you must choose one from this list. You can choose honors english or regular english, but you must take english all 4 years of high school. You can choose what type of physical education class you want, team sports or cardio. It is like this, that school try to sell the lie of giving you choices, but the choices are very limited. You are forced their curriculum no matter what.

Then, you are force fed more bullshit which tells you to go to college and pick out a major. Again, majors are limited and they all fucking suck. Even when you choose a major, you are required to do the general education classes which is just a repeat of the last 4 years of high school, You are forced to take this and that class, in the guise of a well rounded education. What well rounded means is simply standardized. Everyone has to take the same crap yet again, as if high school wasnt bad enough.

Some degree programs suck and others really suck. Any way you go, you will be forced to do assignments that frustrate you, group projects that blow, take tests that all fall on the same god damn day, and deal with boring professors and worthless classes. Whatever major you choose, rest assured it will be a disappointment.

Then you graduate from college with your student loans and debt to the education system. It is here that you realize that employers look for experience, not a degree. So you are stuck looking at jobs, applying places with consistent rejections because there is someone out there who has more work experience than you. But those student loan payments need to be repaid, so after a while of searching, you end up stuck and taking some piece of crap job you never even wanted. They sell you the idea that you can pick and choose your place of work, but thats bullshit. It is hard enough to get interviews, let alone be the best candidate out of the 8 that they speak with. In the end, you end up accepting whatever offer (if you can get one) that you get. Not easy to reject an offer because it doesnt pay as much as you like when it took you 6 months to get it, and you havent a clue if/when another offer might come through. Its a crapshoot, however, what is very certain is that whatever job you end up taking, it will suck. This is for an endless amount of reasons, but to put it simply, working totally fucking blows. The job you get will suck and will unlikely use anything you've learned in the last 4 years of college. You could have probably done it in middle school. But they'll put preference on candidates with 5 years experience and a master's degree. 

But no one questions college, the same failing system stays in place every year for each new freshman class. As long as students become debt slaves, that's all that matters. It doesn't matter that the system itself is broken and screwing us all over.

The bottom line is that the choices you apparently make are just not there. You can choose a major, but you still have to take all these classes. You can choose a class, but regardless of which one you choose, each has 3 major exams and a final exam. You can choose a job, but each does not pay enough and involves you commuting in traffic, siting in a cubicle for 8 hours, commuting back in traffic again, arriving at home burnt out, and doing it almost every day of your week, spare week ends. Many people are paid so poorly in their main jobs, that they take extra jobs to make ends meet. Fun times indeed.

What is so sad is that this is the typical process a young person must go through. It is not a case of picking a bad experience and elaborating on about it. No, this is THE STANDARD AMERICAN situation one goes through as a child to young adult. And It fucking blows.


If you think about the whole ordeal, education and college sells you the idea that you can choose what you want to do and work hard to succeed, but it is a load of crap, much like everything else they sell us. As long as we are in debt and owe them money, theyve got us by the balls.

A final point - retirement is also bullshit. By the time you can retire, you're old and often your health is on the decline, that is if you even make it to retirement. Many people do not. The whole thing is a farce, because your whole life you try to save for retirement, but once you get it you're old and unable to enjoy things the same way as in youth. You're health is on the decline, and you are not attractive due to aging. It's probably fun for a few months, but eventually you will grow bored of the endless amount of free time on hand. 

Imagine spending decades working and saving only to find you become bored with all your time upon reaching the golden retirement years. I know I didn't believe that myself, but bouts with unemployment have shown me that not working is not all it's cracked up to be either. Fun for a little while, but it does grow stale quicker than you might think. Everything does.",6085,Problem Gambling,19:19:46

Start observing yourself. Make it your mission to notice every time you avoid something. Start a list, and record every incident. Awareness is a vital first step.
Look through the list, and notice the themes. Is there a trend toward avoiding social situations? Risks? Goals? Feelings? Needs?
Start, little by little, one step at a time, facing things. How pervasive is your avoidance? If it is everywhere of everything, I urge you to seek a therapists help. If you have success on your own, be persistent. Dont give up, no matter how hard it gets.",1907,None,13:29:39

I installed win 10 and everything was fine for about 2 Weeks or so. after this time my win crashed weekly ( after the crashes , i couldnt boot from my ssd anymore ) and i had to reinstall it. After the reinstallations it worked another week or two until it crashes. after redoing this like 10 times i was like ""fuck it, im getting a completly new pc"" Because mine was old anyway and i needed an upgrade for videoediting and gaming. So i got myself a new one with ddr4 ram , 1080 gtx  , i7 8700k. So every component of this pc was new even a new ssd. So everything worked fine for like 2 months then the same Thing with the crashes happend to my new ssd the exact same thing. So i reinstalled it and it worked. 2 Weeks later i recogniced after another reinstallation of windows the msi logo wasnt shown anymore while booting and i got a blackscreen while entering the bios Setting there is nothing i could do to get a signal or something. but windowes booted fine.
And today i think im gonna lose my Sanity.
While i was trying to fix the blackscreen bios problem in fear of my ssd crashing again and not beeing able to boot from my usb anymore cuz i cant switch the boot priorities. The worst case happend and now i cant see my bios or bootmenu and im not able to boot windows.
Im dealing with this now for almost a year and im tierd. Ive spend countless hours searching for a solution and nothing worked. This is my last hope that one of you guys got a solution or similar problems with a fix.

So Im back here and hopefully will stay. I didnt sleep all week. My online betting company sent my free spins last Monday so I won 4.800 in just few spins and guess what it all gone every single penny. I deposited first thing when won but in one hour reversed that deposit and all gone in a week. Plus sleepless nights over last 6 months and loss of another 4K on sports gambling. So when I won 4800 on slots was over the moon said ok Im done but not the little gambler in my head said come on boy on more spin and I couldnt believe it, it all gone.

I thought I was going to get rich through doing it but after two years I just used up all my money and more. Also my relationships disappeared as I isolated myself. Ended up getting divorced and moving back in with my family. Im 37 so this was a big wake up call.

However, over the last week I convinced myself that I could go back to trading currency if only I do this and that but yeah this didnt work. I actually blowed the account faster. In less than two days actually. This is a joke. 

Over the last few weeks I was missing my ga meetings and as much I dont want to admit it I really need to commit to going to it every week. 

Any way I see the light again and realise that I am a gambler for life and I just cant control myself when it comes to executing trades or poker or anything like that. 

Feeling a bit dirty cause I was on such a good path and cant believe I tricked myself into thinking I could turn my trading into a viable business when Im at the helm. 

Anyway needed to get this off my chest.

However, lucky for me my family just wanted for me to get back on track and they didnt disown me like I thought they would. I now have a steady job and have reduced my debt to-20k (i also just opened a savings account - which is just weird but with about 8 bucks in it haha) and most of all the relationships in my life a actually there.

Almost every caller literally bugs the living hell out of me and I sit there seething with anger the entire day. Their voices, their canned responses, even their annoying politeness. It is the same boring task day in and day out for 8 hours a day, listening to the damn phone ring and wanting to tear my damn eyes out of there sockets from both the boredom and the parallel annoyance of people on the phone.

Life is absolutely dreadful. At the end of every day I am so tired from the 8 hours of shit that I don't have any energy to do anything but lay down and rest, just collapse on the floor. You fall asleep, and then wake up to another awful day of the same day you've lived 1000 days in a row. I'm finding this increasingly humiliating, and growing deeper and deeper into despair due to my inability to just keep coping with a cage that closes in tighter and tighter.

I don't know how so many people can just simply deal with this for years... I mean we need the money so I get that, but the sacrifice is just too extreme. I guess the big boys in power designed it this way, and we who can't cope just get to pay the price every single day.",6085,None,02:24:20

2019-01-25,I feel i wanna suicide,"Hey ..
This is probably the last thing I'll write in my life.
My story is not very different from most people here.
I am a 26 years male, gambling addict since 5 years.
I am an immigant who came to Europe looking for a better life, I studied cybersecurity and then worked as a security analyst  in a big company for one year, I had a decent salary and it was more than enough for living.
Then i started to gamble and life changed completly, i think most of people here understand how your life become when u become a gambler.
I had two suicide attempts failed both because Police arrested me when i were trying to jump from a building but this time I think I ll make it in my home alone.

Here is the reason I wanna end my life, i lost everything, i mean mooney, home, work, everything for gambling.

I decided to go to my country to clean my head from this shit and start a new life because i live in a small village near to beach and there is no place there where i can gamble.
I asked my family for mooney a lot of times and they send me a lot of mooney until the point they couldnot for more because i spent it all in gambling.

The last mooney they send me was yesterday and they made it clear, this is the last thing wen can give u, buy your ticket and come home.

So, Instead of buying my ticket i went to gamble for last time (i said just 10 euro and then the 10 euro became 70 euro) which the ticket price, and now u can imagine how i feel, I just have 1 euro left in my pocket. I cannot go to my country because i lost my ticket money and I cannot ask my family for more because I dont know what to tell them, I cannot tell them I lost it in gambling becuse they are very traditional and they will.not accept it, i have to lie and I hate to lie, and also feel bad for them.
How the hell my life changed, from a respecteful security analyst  to a jungie homeless piece of shit.
Now I am stuck here, no mooney for go home and dont know what to do, i feel i just wanna end this all and suicide",2468,Recovery,19:11:39

2019-01-26,My story,"Hey there everyone. I am Jake F and I am a compulsive gambler. My last bet was 5 /17 /18. I started going to G.A. June 1st. It was a life changer. 
 Let's see I started gambling when I was around 10 years old. ( I am 44 now)I would ride a chartered bus up to the University of Georgia football games with my parents and brother. On the way up tgey would have a gambling pool where you picked all the games of the week. It would cost $10 per sheet. My dad would pay and I would pick. I loved it. I learned about point spreads and such and fell in love with it. Within a couple years I was running the pool. By age 16 I had started betting with bookies and did pretty well. Then went to college and started a book making service. But I missed the action from picking games. So I stopped being a bookie and went back to gambling. I started then to enjoy cards. Poker and blackjack. But living in Georgia it wasn't easy to get to casinos back then. 
At age 28 I got married and slowed down gambling. I was saving money, paying bills and such. We own BBQ restaurants and make decent money so I was living a pretty good life. We then had a kid and things changed. I was home all the time and bored. This was at the time internet gambling started as well. I was back!!! I started playing all the time. Ling story short I ruined my marriage and lost a fortune. I was always a very heavy drinker/ alcoholic. So I decided to stop drinking. Thinking my life would get back on track. Well I replaced drinking by gambling even more this time. Again long story short I ended up having to spend a week in jail because of not paying for a DUI because I gamblied everything I made except for kids money. I almost lost my girlfriend of 3 years because I had lied about so much. 
That's when I went to GA. 8 months later and I'm a changing man. Getting better day by day. Being a much better father, boyfriend and man. 
It works. One day at a time. 
There is much more horror stories from my gambling but seemed too long. 
Make it a great day and as always stay classy planet Earth.",9154,Relapse,20:31:37

2019-02-21,My story,"Hopefully this may help someone 
I started gambling when I was around 10 years old. I would help my dad run football parlay sheets. By the age of 12 I was doing this on my own. Our family owns restaurants so I was able to work when I wanted to to make money so I always had disposable income. By the age of 16 I was gambling with bookies. I wasn't betting out of control but I loved it. When I went to college I started bookmaking myself. I did this for a year but didn't enjoy it like I did gambling myself. So I stopped and started back betting with bookies. Around this age I started playing cards as well. I had always played with my parents and was quite good. I loved poker and blackjack. I was also becoming a heavy drinker as well. At 28 I got married and slowed down everything. A couple years later we had our first child. This is when I found internet gambling. I was home at night with the family and bored. I started playing poker, blackjack and betting sports online. I gambled a lot. I opened my own business and used all the money from the business to support my drinking and gambling. During this time we had our second child and I got worse gambling. I lost everything. Had to close the business. I never told my wife about the gambling. She ended up divorcing me. She mainly blamed alcohol for everything. After divorce I got worse drinking. One day I decided to quit drinking thinking everything would get better. I was an alcoholic and quitting would cure all. Well I started gambling more. I went back working with the family and started using money from the business to gamble. I had gotten a DUI years earlier and had a fine to pay, but I didn't pay it. I gambled the money away everytime I got it. Well I ended up violating probation and went to jail. I was from an upper class family and had everything I ever wanted but I was in jail because I wouldn't pay a fine because I wanted to gamble. I had hit bottom. The day I got out I went to a G.A meeting. 5/17/18. It saved my life. G.A has changed everything. I found people who are like me. I found a way out. The 12 steps are a lifeline to us compulsive gamblers. My relationship with my daughters ( which I didn't mention much because it hurts to talk about) has gotten great. My family and I are back to being close. Our business is thriving. My financial situation is getting so much better. I'm a much better son, brother, boyfriend, and father thanks to G.A. 
If you are suffering from this addiction please seek help and go to a meeting if possible. It works. If you have questions please feel free to ask. Send me a message. I'm 9 months clean and it's amazing!!!",9154,Help Seeking,00:58:44

I  can't change the past, I've apologized many times but whenever I get upset about something, she brings all what I did up. I sometimes just want to say fuck-it and gamble, and get drunk. I'm also a recovering alcoholic. Trying to keep my head straight but it's hard. Got a G.A meeting tomorrow night so I'm hoping this will help. Prayers needed. As always Stay Classy Planet Earth

2019-02-25,"Rock, Meet Hard Place.","I had to quit my part-time job last month because it was killing me. After collapsing at work twice and fainting once, after being put on sickness and absence monitoring *again -*  just like I was in the job before and the one before that - because being chronically ill doesn't stop me from getting acutely ill, after repeatedly telling my managers that I couldn't work the shift patterns they were asking for and no 'thinking positively' will not stop me from crashing because that's not how it works, the final straw came just after Christmas when one (1) unexpected flight of steps added to my commute meant I couldn't even make it in.

We live in suburban London, and even with a mortgage that's considerably cheaper than most city rents and no kids to think about, my husband doesn't earn enough to support us both. The only thing that made my leaving my terrible job even remotely financially viable was that we had a lodger.

Guess what? Our lodger wants to move out in a week. It took us months to find her.

I have no idea what I'm going to do. I'm no more employable than I was yesterday. I'm looking for part-time jobs and have been since I quit, but there's nothing out there that isn't wildly unsuitable due to commute time or the hours they're asking for. I've looked into working from home, but have yet to find a single vacancy that doesn't have a strong whiff of the scammy about it. I'm terrified of even trying to apply for disability because I know the DWP will tell me I'm fit to work, even though I have a formal diagnosis and two employers have told me quite categorically that my sickness-related unreliability means I'm not. What the Hell do other people do when things get this bad? My husband says he isn't blaming me, but I am.",8139,Help Seeking,00:53:25

To be totally fair, this is more than just a Bushi thing. A lot of established franchises do similar things with new characters, and it can read as jarring and overcompensatory there too. RAS's introduction came off, to me, as Bushi saying *you will pay attention to these New Shinies who are being treated as instantly and effortlessly more interesting and accomplished than the characters you already know and love now*, and I resented that. I'm here for PasuPale and Afterglow, not for five new characters who are immediately and unsubtly presented as so far out of their league that Ran can't even see it from where she's standing, never mind all the time and work Ran put in to get where she is in the first place. That might be a fair depiction of the music business, but what it's not is satisfying storytelling. I like the music, I even like a lot of the characters, but I just can't get behind RaS as a unit the way the franchise seems to want to talk me into doing.",8139,None,16:19:17

I was hoping to make it through March madness and I put myself into $20K debt by round 1.  I was lucky enough to win it all back plus $49K more!

I was doing my budget yesterday and someone in this chat posted how they are betting on themselves when they put money into savings.

I have such a strong urge that if I take out 1/3 of my paycheck I can place a parlay bet and win 8-10 times my paycheck. I only need to go 3-3. Once I go 3-3 then Ill have a big enough bankroll to place bets 1 game at a time.

There is no chance of me cashing out winnings if I win. I will only buy in more and lose my pay check and then chase into my credit cards and then take loans out to pay the credit cards only to gamble again.

Eventually I sold some stocks that werent even fully mine to cut those debts by 50% and then somehow paid off the rest of the debts with winnings.

My family found out when the IRS bill came in the mail from the stock sale which forced me to come clean. Of course I still gambled until 9 days ago when I joined this group.

My grandparents were so serious about their Christian faith that my grandmother was an ordained priest, while I spent most of my teens and twenties self-identifying as an atheist. Here's the thing, though: I'm now a Christian myself. I mention this not for the sake of the sales pitch, but because I've been on both sides of the table here.

Easter? Easter is a big deal for Christians, far bigger than Christmas. It's the most important religious festival of the year. Of course your grandparents are going to want to talk about God and Christ and their faith at Easter. Of course they're going to want to pray. You would not be an asshole for broaching the issue of your own beliefs with them now you're getting older. You would, however, be being incredibly tactless if you brought any of this up over dinner on Resurrection Sunday.

If you genuinely respect their beliefs, you need to give them space to express their faith around you, because part of having faith is professing it. You're going to have to sit quietly through pre-dinner prayers and cope with them being churchy during the key religious festivals of the Christian calendar.

2019-04-24,,"I'm gonna have to say NAH. Here's why.

I understand completely that you were desperate to leave an abusive home and rightly or wrongly saw your girlfriend and her family as an escape route. That you refer to your high school girlfriend's parents as 'the in-laws', however, makes you sound a little presumptuous, and showing up at their home without any real warning makes you look it. I totally understand why you did it, but looked at from their perspective you're asking an awful lot of them and giving them very little but your company in return.

You don't mention the age of your girlfriend, but I'm going to assume she's your age - so, between sixteen and eighteen years old. I'm not surprised she's not mature enough to start cohabiting and, since two weeks of it was enough for you to fall out of love with her, by the sounds of it neither are you. It sounds to me as if you were attracted to what she represented - family, stability - rather than to her as a person. I'm also not surprised that her parents are resenting suddenly finding themselves with another adolescent kid to raise - meaning someone who takes all the same resources as an adult, but who still needs to be supported like a child. They'd have to be super-human not to be feeling the strain. Are you contributing to the household expenses in any way? Offering to help out about the house? Because your presence gives them another person to feed, clothe and take care of even before you start factoring in them joining any and all family excursions.

There's no good way to find out that something you intended to be a nice surprise would not have been well received. To me, this genuinely seems the best way this could have ended: before time, and early enough things could be relatively easily cancelled. This is definitely disappointing and upsetting, but I think realizing my husband was smiling through his own surprise party and counting the minutes until it was over would be a lot worse. Having him come to me afterward and quietly ask me never to do something like that again wouldn't be much less awkward and upsetting.

The best surprises usually aren't, in reality, that big of a surprise, because the recipient has established beforehand that they'd like to be surprised this way - and it needs to have come from them, not from the people around them. I'm an introvert myself, and if I came home tired wanting peace and quiet, the last thing I'd want sprung on me is a house party. Honestly, if I caught wind of the idea that my husband was planning something behind my back that was costing him money, time and effort, and which I suspected I would not be able to appreciate, I'd want to find out what it was too. I'd want to save him the effort, and use the money on something we could both enjoy.

+ The he-nutter has now gone into business as a dog cloning doula or something, middle-manning for other nutters who are equally incapable of accepting mortality.

+ She-nutter stopped eating and drinking after Doggo Prime died, and this is apparently what got he-nutter onto the idea of cloning him as opposed to, say, finding her the grief counselling she clearly still needs.

This story worries me, and not because of who is or isn't in the right here. I read around dress shopping in the run-up to my wedding and OP, there is a genuine danger that **you've been scammed** and will end up with no money *and* no dress.

Where did you buy this dress? A lot of the sites offering prom and bridal dresses on the cheap will send out poorly-made and sometimes shockingly ugly knock-offs. The dresses that customers recieve can look nothing like the photographs on the site (which have been taken from legitimate retailers and reposted), are obviously cheaply and often poorly-made. and in some cases aren't even the same *color* as the photograph. There have been stories of dresses like this being made of a single layer of lining silk, arriving crammed into air mail wallets, being creased or already damaged when they are received or tearing when tried on, and to add insult to injury being woefully ill-fitting. If your sister gets a dress like some of the knock-offs I've seen *she won't be able to wear it whether she wants to or not*, because the dress will be awful and she'll look ridiculous.

A $400 dress is $400 for a reason. The quantity of materials and quality of workmanship mean that there's simply no way they can be produced for $80. They just *can't*. These sites constantly claim to be holding 'sales' to make their customers feel pressured to buy *now* or risk losing out on the 'bargain'. The reason for the strict 30-day return policy on an item that will take that long just to arrive? That's because in many cases the dress won't even have cleared customs before the return window has closed, meaning that by the time the customer realizes they've been sold a pup it's too late for them to complain and demand their money back. Very often it's also too close to the event they needed it for for them to find a replacement dress, too.

I tried to link you to some sites that explained things further, but Autimod wasn't having any of it. I'd strongly advise you to Google 'counterfeit wedding dress' and see what you can do about cancelling the sale and getting your money back. A lot of the same scammers who target brides also prey on young girls looking for prom gowns as well, who very often lack the money for their 'dream dress' and are much more vulnerable. There are a lot of horror stories out there, and this legitimately *could* completely ruin your sister's prom.",8139,Motivated,09:34:29

I'm already reaching the point I can't progress reliably at all without pulling dupes of dupes of units I can barely get to drop to begun with, and I'm starting to lose interest completely.

I'm sure the whole thing's been worked out very precisely and that statistically drop rates have to be set where they are because something something continuing revenues something whales something.

The sound MAY cut out that side, and literally just twisting the cable while it's plugged in left or right a tiny bit fixes this back to normal... unplugging and replugging the cable in also does it. Once you twist the cable a tiny bit, it sorts itself out ..... seems to be just not a perfect connection ALL THE TIME that the 2.5 mm jack gets inside the right cup.

To be clear, IF it ever cuts out, once you twist the cable a bit you're all good. This is only an intermittent thing that you may run into.

I will only sell and ship within the USA.

Not me. I'm scared of dogs. Scared. Of. *Dogs*. I don't know why someone's 'right' to bring their precious arsing emotional crutch to the office should trump another employee's right to do their job without fear, and that is absolutely what dogs provoke in me. Actual, genuine *fear*. And no, I am not about to seek therapy for my fear of dogs simply because someone else has developed an equally pathological co-dependency on their 'pupper'.

The fucking things are everywhere and if you're not delighted to see them people act like you're seriously deviant. No, I do not think the presence of some smelly, slobbering hound will reduce my stress levels or make me a happier employee: it's going to have quite the opposite effect. No I do not want a dog in the waiting room to make my trip to the dentist even *more* terrifying. It's getting to the point I'm starting to think that any advance directive I write will need to have a 'DON'T BRING ANY THERAPY DOGS TO MY BEDSIDE, LIKE, EVER, BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE ME FEEL *WORSE*, GOD DAMMIT' rider.

Most of us spend our day in a cube (which honestly is going to be smaller than a jail cell) and you are forced to do the same damn tasks over and over again. This causes mind numbing boredom and exhaustion. This forms the great majority of your week, where driving to and from the cell takes up more of your time, but of course that time is not paid... sunrise to sunset, in a cube.

I feel like I am in jail at work. I don't have any freedoms. I am forced to obey, to do and answer to whatever tasks are placed on my desk. It is awful. I am a servant.  Sure you can try to escape to a different prison (a different company) but at the end of the day, 8 hours of prison is 8 hours of prison no matter where you go.

Most employers give you a whopping 2 weeks off per 52 week year. Like, are you kidding me? You will probably need more than that when you get sick and can't even come in. But that's all, that's what you get. Or maybe not, as more and more jobs become temp jobs which give you zero healthcare benefits and zero time off. Temp jobs are cancer on society.

You are also surrounded by drones who have no idea what is going on. They are clueless, they are smiling, and they ""enjoy"" slaving away to benefit those above. Your co-workers think you just have a bad attitude, that your an unpleasant person, as they smile and laugh with stupid memes and jokes.

Yes, you get to go home at the end of the day, but with drained energy and a horrible fatigue from dealing with another day of bullshit. The weekends are a chance to fuel up the battery so you can work yet another week. They have to give you that time off to take care of the other tasks required of a job (clean your clothes, get some food, fill the gas tank, pay those bills).

The system is designed without your interests in mind. It's designed to enslave you and drain you of all your energy. The job will over the years drive you crazy. It will rob you of your vital life energy and convert you to become a mindless, numb, miserable robot. Work is prison, but they have it so twisted that those who want out of work are looked at as lazy losers. Our society congratulates people for finding a new job, for getting promoted, and shames those who are fired or quit the endlessly spinning hamster wheel of corporate america. 

Every day ends up destroying me. I go in with some level of energy, and in one, two or three hours, I'm all drained out and ready to be home. Except I can't, the work day is 8 hours, not 2 or 3. It's 8 hours exactly, every single day, regardless of the day, regardless of how I feel.

Now, I was an eleven year old girl with an established fear of dogs, and I only really got on with my grandparents' well-behaved terriers because I trusted (correctly, thank God) that my grandparents would never let them hurt me. *This* dog, on its hind legs with its paws on my body, was only slightly shorter than me, putting its snout about level with my face. My reaction to this slobbering, panting creature flinging itself at me? I panicked, tried to push the dog away and said - apparently, I didn't recall saying any such thing - 'get this damn dog off me'.

I got him acclimated to my presence around him and to me reaching out to touch him by letting him make the running as far as was possible. For much of the two-year period before he came round to me, I tried to get him used to the idea by reaching my hand out to him, but not actually trying to touch him - just letting him sniff me and then walk away. I did also try and pet him while he was eating, but this was *just* petting him, and if he got up and walked away I backed off and let him be for a while. I also found that he responded *very* well to a Feliway diffuser: these don't work for all cats, but one day after plugging it in he was visibly more relaxed and inclined to be social. Most of the final steps that got him to get comfortable with my stroking him happened after we started using Feliway. I also rewarded him with treats the first few times he let me pet him properly. He's since found that being petted is it's own reward!

A faithful representation of my mother as she was to me when I was young and impressionable is the woman who stays at home with her small children, who runs errands with them in town, and who cooks and cleans in between childcare duties. In an apron, where necessary - better that than soaking or staining her clothes.

She was no less of a *super mom* (or 'mum', given that we're English) because she wasn't working at the same time, and this is not to say that working moms are any less as a result.

I have not told my mother that I know she told my fianc because I promised my fianc I wouldnt. It is eating my alive that I havent said anything.

I keep telling my fianc we need to move on from the past and its not about the amount of money. I still dont want to tell her my loses over last 4 years was over $150,000. She just needs to know I am now debt free. She keeps bringing up the past. I just want to focus on my new clean life and not talk about the past.

I gave control over my fantasy baseball team to a friend because I dont want to trigger gambling. I did check how he was doing yesterday and my fianc saw it on my phone. It was stupid of me to check it but it didnt trigger anything and I have since deleted it on my phone.  Rightfully so my fianc is very upset right now.

I still havent gambled and I am debt free.

She now wants to go to counseling. I read the Allen Carr book and am a firm believer it in.

Counseling will lead to GA and I do not want to put that in her mind as it is not an option for me.

I want her to read the book and then put the past in the past and move on a fresh clean life.

Is there any advice on how I should approach my fianc?",1530,Problem Gambling,17:08:34

I was physically ill this morning starting the day with 5$ left in my pocket. I Have tried 100 of strategies on pretty much every casino table game / sportsbook.  The house edge is impossible to beat long term.  They say certain games only a 1-2% house advantage like blackjack . Anyone that regularly plays the game knows the advantage is alot more than that due to the fact that you act first.  I know i always leave the table broke playing by the  book  strategy . Then ya got the supposed card counters that claim you can gain a sizeable advantage counting . Maybe single deck .. but no casino outside of a few in vegas have that.  In 25 yrs at casino  i have yet to see someone count and predict 8 decks in a shoe.  There actually a reddit category devoted to blackjack card counting  .  What a joke.

I get mail from them almost everyday sometimes multiple brochures in a day. Think  the only way out for me is self exclusion ... heard that is barely enforced at most casinos though  ... unless you win then they wont pay you.

2019-06-20,"Issues Sitting, Does this sound like POTS?","I went to a cardiologist recently, complaining about a really fast heart rate and various other symptoms. I often get  a heavy, aching chest pressure. It builds and builds and reaches an overwhelming point, often with my heart racing. It often feels like I am breathing into an all ready full chest and just am not ""soaking"" up the air internally so to speak. It is really uncomfortable to breathe in and not feel as if the air is going inside the body.

Now to stop myself from droning on about how miserable this is making me, I want to add that I went to the ER, and they couldn't find anything wrong with my blood tests or ECG or X-Ray other than my heart routinely pumps 125-150. I had a few ECGS with this happening, and they are all around 125-150 BPM. 

Apparently this is sinus tach, but it is exhausting when all day my heart is going nuts and racing.

So to the punchline, I go to the cardiologist and he strongly thinks this is POTS. Yes, my heart goes pretty fast when standing (goes up to like 120, higher if walking), but that part doesn't bother me that much. I am bothered by the fact that all day, sitting at work in a chair, my heart pretty steady runs at like 100. I don't have to get up at all, and my heart just runs fast almost all day long. This makes me doubt that what I have is POTS, even though my cardiologist seems confident he is right. I got some Midodrine, but my BP usually runs like 130/60, so I don't feel like taking something to higher my all ready elevated BP makes a whole lot of sense. I have taken it a few times, but I still seem to have the same overwhelming chest pressure and shortness of breath issues. I also get these sharp shooting pains sometimes left and right side throughout my day, which are very painful and uncomfortable. 

Lately, I have felt very tired and off, I just don't know what's wrong with me and am afraid the cardiologist threw out POTS cause he doesn't know either. I'm going to have an echo done as well, but so far no doctor has noticed much other than a very fast heart rate, which I wouldn't even mind so much but I also have the severe chest pain and shortness of breath.


Anyone else relate to my symptoms or have issues sitting all day at work? Usually after 1 hour of sitting I am all ready having issues and I have to sit 8 hours a day. Maybe if this is POTS, I just have a severe case where I can't sit OR stand without discomfort?

This all started after a case of pneumonia I had about 6 months ago, doctor said an illness like that can trigger POTS...",6085,Motivated,04:22:53
2019-06-20,It's all a scam,"I think a lot of us try for our lives to find the diamonds in the rough so to speak in terms of all aspects of life. We try to find the best job with the best pay(good luck with that one), the hottest gf we can get(lol as if that's gonna happen), the nicest car we can drive(2001 dodge stratus), the best college we can attend etc. I have realized that it's all basically a scam. For instance, I am a wage slave and I hate my job. I'm spending my whole life making other people richer while I get paid enough to come back and work again tomorrow. It's a damn scam. I have recently been trying to learn how to day trade stocks to escape that scam, but I realize it's probably more of a scam than my job. At least at work I don't lose money on a daily basis.

Although I am a big believer in retraining my brain will stop the gambling thoughts and make me a non gambler.

I will admit I am very glad I went to the meeting. I will definitely go back just not on a daily or weekly basis. There was great positive energy there, however there was also a lot of negative energy.

People saying they will be a gambler the rest of their life and its something they need to focus on daily.

I lost over $350K in 4 years and gambling ruined my life. However I have mixed feelings about the person that is negative and saying that we will always be gamblers till we die and never get rid of this addiction.

2019-06-30,For lurkers who may think they have a day trading problem.,"Gambling is a form of entertainment that involves taking a risk with money. All types of gambling are characterized by an irreversible bet where chance determines the outcome in part or in whole, resulting in a win or a loss (Ladouceur, Sylvain, Boutin,   Doucet, 2002). These characteristics can also be applied to stock market trading, where transactions involve fees and the market can shift in favor or disfavor of an investors financial interests. A short-term timeframe makes returns practically impossible to predict, thus making it akin to gambling (Chordia, Roll,   Subrahmanyam, 2005).",1907,None,00:28:28

2019-07-05,Day 1 - Time to celebrate,"Yesterday I lost 1k on online roulette.

Today I'm starting fresh, I feel so good, I feel like celebrating.

Abit of background...

I've gambled for the last 10 or so years and estimate I've lost around 20 - 25k as well as being in 12k debt. I started on the fobt's, playing roulette, the evil of gambling, up until recently where the 2 max bet come in to effect, those based in the UK will know what I'm talking about and then I moved to online betting (something I had told myself I would never do, due to ease of access). Anway for the last couple of months I have been gambling online and losing hence I'm here, its all good when you're winning you've got money you don't care even if it is only for short period of time before you gamble it away. Now I have decided Ive had enough, I want my life back, I want to build a better life.

Im 28 years old and currently live at home , I should have enough saved up for a deposit on a house like my friends but here I am in debt with no savings. Unfortunately I do not have friends I can talk to this about its just not something I can disclose to them and my family would never look at me again in the same way if I told them of my situation so that is definitely not an option. 

So today I need to take control myself, I've started by signing up to gamstop so I can't gamble online and I've decided to make this post, I've lurked around on reddit for a while not specifically gambling related subreddits but today I decided to search and found this brilliant subreddit.

So why do I feel like celebrating? This is the first day of the rest of my life, a happy successful life. I feel motivated and whilst I did stop in the past for ~8 months this time I know I can't think I am no longer a problem gambler and a little bet won't hurt as it goes back to that cycle I'm sure many of you are familiar with, chasing losses and all that. 

As I cant speak to anyone about this and as I am still in control of my own finances I'm hoping to find people here that can support me and return I can support them on a daily basis to finally be gamble free! I want this post to be about motivation, will power, strength and celebrating successes but at the same time if you are feeling down, or have just lost gambling don't feel afraid to reply we're are here to support one another. Make your day 1 celebration today! And if you gambled today, then guess what your day 1 celebration is tomorrow.

I really believe regularly talking about this will help so please do feel free to message me, spam me with messages if you like I will do the same back it doesn't even have to be about gambling it can be about how you feel good today and how you're going to feel good tomorrow, why? Because you haven't lost money on nothing, you don't feel guilty, you're in a better position than yesterday you were before because it's been x days/months/years since you gambled.

Anyway, its Friday, I'm going to relax have a beer and wake up everyday with motivation, passion and strive for what I want and count my blessings along the way.",2867,Problem Gambling,20:23:17

The cashout machines are frequently out of service to make you walk to another.  Funny how I have never once seen a ATM  out of service. ATMs are quite plentiful also.

The raffle drawings require you to be present for sometimes 5 hrs to listen if your name is called. Then there the basic casino tricks. No clocks , windows, confusing layout, free cheap booze .

2019-07-25,"Approaching 100 days, looking back","I'm at 92 days after having gambled almost daily for more than 20 years.  Most of my gambling has been on sports and forex trading.  

Looking back on the last 90+ days.  I've had a few urges but for the most part it has been pretty smooth.  I've had tons of extra time since quitting and i'm spending that time with my wife and kids, a win for everybody.  I also find that I'm generally much happier and more calm now.  You know how your body gets into 'emergency mode' when you're stressed or in danger, I was basically in that mode 24:7 before.  I was up at night watching, stressed and pissed during the day, and constantly contemplating suicide.

Today, I spend my free time with family.  I also listen to alot of podcasts about personal growth and about addiction in general.  I've been exercising more as well which not only keeps me busy, it also keeps me fit.  

GA: not a big ga guy.  Went to a handful of meetings, never liked it.  Maybe I'm making a mistake, but being on reddit daily and reading the posts on this group is my version of GA.  I've also created some relationships with people I've met on this group and we chat on whatsapp daily, I find that super helpful.  Jamies podcast was great but I worked through that pretty quick.  Also worked through Alan Carr's book, find it very helpful.  

My biggest disappointment in recovery is that the my financial stresses have not been calmed.  I guess I was unrealistic to think that I would quit and magically all my debt would disappear.  That being said, nothing is beyond my higher power and I continue to pray daily and put all my faith in Gd.  

I will continue to not only not gamble one day at a time, but also to live life one day at a time.  Life is challenging regardless, but it's infinately better this way than the other.",9941,Problem Gambling,10:05:46

I'm specifically asking about the game(s) you've played that have given you the most incredible moments, the intense rushes, the ""WOW"" experiences that we all know PSVR is capable of delivering that many other mediums cannot.

For me, I'd say WIPEOUT is the one. My jaw has dropped many times playing it, it's so much fun and so immersive to ride the rollercoaster like tracks. Such a rush. I wish there was some more futuristic racers like this. POLYBIUS is another, the speed is just silly and the game just dazzles with it's use of intense flashy and bright colors.

I got no new 3* at all (seriously?? I'm missing *so many*) and one new 2* Ran which I'm weirdly happy with because Ran is my favorite girl besides Aya. Not too bad, I guess!

From what I have read I think some tough love may be needed here, obviously your boyfriend knows he has a problem with gambling but says nothing will work and he has tried everything. Maybe sitting him down and making him realise its not the end of the world, he needs to get a grip and take control of his life and it is possible to get out of debt. 

Help him put some measures in places, excluding himself, signing up to gamstop, GA, this sub etc and then focus on a day at a time. Just focus on living his life each day, go back to finding enjoyment in the small things, things that don't even cost money, the gambling urge will slowly start to go and he'll start feeling positive. The debt situation will remain but not gambling is going to be a big part of clearing that. Its going to take some hard work but things that help is counting your blessings, there are people all over the world in worse situation that yourself, he has by the sounds of things a supportive partner and family and a job.

2019-08-15,This Used to Be Fun,"In just over two weeks' time, my husband and I are going on holiday.

I'm dreading it.

We're going to Germany, a country I first visited at the age of sixteen and fell in love with, by Eurostar and first-class rail. We're going back to Cologne, where I stayed with my school, so I can properly visit the cathedral this time. Then we're going to spend four days in Berlin, a city I have been talking about visiting pretty much since we first met, over ten years ago. We spend a few days in Frankfurt after that, before heading home.

I'm dreading it.

I'm dreading it because I look and feel like crap right now. I'm dreading it because I slept for fifteen hours out of the last twenty-four and I'm still utterly exhausted. I'm dreading it because I can't remember the last time I could walk even a medium distance without pain, without feeling short of breath, without needing to stop and rest. I'm dreading it because I don't own a wheelchair even though I desperately need one, even though the one day I did go out and rent a chair it made my life so much more bearable and the things I was doing actually enjoyable. I'm dreading the aches in my limbs, dreading the building exhaustion, dreading gritting my teeth and grinning and bearing it as I fight my way through having fun. I'm dreading it because I'm 37 and live like a frail eighty-year-old. And I'm dreading it because I *always* dread these things, because fun isn't fun any more, because every time I try to do anything at all, I have to calculate how much it'll cost me first.

Last year was bad, but last year I could work.

This year, I'm sicker. I sleep more. For much of my time I'm housebound. The only time I really leave is to go shopping at the supermarket once a week, and even *that* feels like too much some days.

My mother-in-law still thinks I should be able to hold down a job. She sends me advertisements for part-time work in my field, as if after leaving two jobs because my bosses didn't think I was physically up to it the right position might still be out there. She thinks because she 'had CFS' - did she? did she actually have it? or did her GP just treat this as a trashcan diagnosis for persistent fatigue? - and got better, I should be recovering too.

My parents still think I'll get better. They talk optimistically, infuriatingly unrealistically, about my building up my endurance. They ask why I don't get out more - just for short walks! They ask why I don't start swimming again. They gently suggest I try to lose some weight. They're more worried about my hypothetically developing diabetes than they are about the condition that's crippling me.

And in two weeks we go on holiday, and a couple of days ago my husband asked me why we didn't just take the train back to the house when we got back to the country, instead of a cab. It'll be quicker, he said. It'll be more convenient, it's only two more changes and a short walk. Even after a ten-day holiday, it's surely not that difficult...

My husband. My parents. My in-laws.

I'm so, so fucking tired.

**ETA:** Talked this over with my husband and explained that I had to get a wheelchair or I simply wouldn't be able to handle the trip, because I'd be too exhausted and in too much pain to manage it. We're going to figure something out and cover the cost *somehow* \- it's not like I'm only going to need it for the next ten days and after that everything will be fine, so we can justify the expense in the long run.

They also needlessly weighed me during a medication review and scolded me for putting on a lot of weight even though all the medications I take and was there to discuss cause weight gain.

I pretended I was fine for a long time, too. The guilt is the worst. Some days it still feels like I'm just not *trying* hard enough, that I'm not sick so much as lazy, that if I just powered on through like a normal human being I'd be... and that's where it all breaks down and reality kicks back in, and I have to remind myself that I'm too ill for that, and that pushing, pushing, *pushing* and pretending I was normal got me here. But it'd be nice if it was, I sometimes think, if I *was* just lazy and I *could* just snap out of it, because then I wouldn't be disabled at all and could just shrug it all off and go back to being like everyone else.

My best friend had a girlfriend with huge boobies. Mine had small breasts. We found it very interesting when discussing our tastes in women that we both were attracted to the opposite of what we had in our relationship - we also were attracted by our partners body types, but when it came to enjoying other body types, we each went for variety and difference.

I have to admit that after winning this 700 bucks quickly, my brain tempted to keep gambling but after checking again the withdrawals policies of online casinos, I saw that they have a ridiculous fees for currency conversions and also for withdrawal timing, these 700 bucks that I requested to cash out wills be just 600 bucks or probably 500 due to the wire transfers policies and also my fucking bank can charge me taxes up to 30% of the total ammount because the funds came from a gambling societ, so my bank consider me as a rich person.

It's ridiculous because even if u win some mooney, u wills not receive it all because Banks wills fuck you from everywhere and specially in third worlds countries banks ....

That all changed my tempting to play again because it has no fucking sens to win mooney online and wait for cash out 10 working days or more and never know how much taxes they will cut you.

2019-08-25,,"Nursing student - I never qualified - pulling twelve-and-a-half hour shifts. Funny thing, though, every time I started a rotation I used to get sick within the first top-three weeks, then have to scramble and squeeze in more shifts to cover the shortfall. I spent most of those days on my feet, and wore through three pairs of very sturdy leather shoes in three years. I'd do two shifts back to back, sometimes three, and then rest and recuperate on my days off.

I remember a community nurse, on one of my placements, picking up the backpack I was going to be taking with me on our rounds and commenting on its weight. I honestly hadn't found it that heavy. Maybe it was a little, but it was nothing I couldn't handle carrying for a day.

When I first met my husband, we walked the city at night for pleasure, so we could spend more time together without having to head back. He lived with his family, I shared a home with a landlady, so night drives and walking together were a way to spend time alone. I realized I loved him when we were down on the sand at the edge of the Thames, at low tide. We spent so much time together on the South Bank, it was where we went for our engagement shoot.

I thought I was just depressed. I was introverted anyway, and that was what depression did, right? It tired you out, it made you want to self-isolate. The breakdown that forced me out of nursing school and onto the dole was purely mental but I was seeing a therapist, wasn't I? My husband, then my boyfriend, eventually suggested that perhaps this wasn't depression, maybe it was CFS. I'd considered it, I told him, briefly...

I was never sporty, but I used to take long walks with my family, used to bike and swim. Once, before I moved to London, I managed a day trip here on one hour's sleep, snatching a brief fifteen minute doze on a museum chair.

2019-08-25,,"Something to avoid. Stands for 'Graded Exercise Therapy', something that's worryingly likely to trigger flare-ups and relapses since it preaches the idea that CFS patients are basically not trying hard enough and have allowed themselves to become 'deconditioned' by... avoiding doing things that are likely to make them feel worse. This gets termed *avoidant behaviour* and treated as aberrant and psychologically damaging instead of vaguely logical. And, since it's all in our heads, we just need to work harder and get over the idea that maybe pain and fatigue are telling us that we should stop doing the things that cause them. We'd soon find out there was nothing to worry about!

In short, it's a protocol that appears to have been dreamed up by my dad. It's bloke-down-the-pub 'common sense' masquerading as medical advice and promoted as a legitimate treatment, because if CFS isn't *really* a disability despite routinely disabling people, that makes it easier for the Government to deny CFS patients disability benefits.",8139,Help Seeking,22:12:52

For one if you dont open robo or scout it in time you are dead when 100000 lings flood your base even if you scout the nydus poping its not garanteed you can kill it since it hits so early and they just keep spaming it at your natural and main and since the nydus is so cheap and when 1 goes up you are dead.

But which bothers me the most as Toss Player who has still flashbacks back from playing Hots.
This damn Swarmhosts in combination with nydus. Locust kill your base in like 2 seconds since their dps is so damn high they can kill  your army in seconds and thats all for free they just can spam you to death. And since their is the nydus you cant even catch them.

I couldnt imagine a single situation where i would wanted to go to the nydus my own maybe in the super lategame with a small harassment troop but other than that i cant.

Other thing which drives me insane is that every match against zerg i play they rush overlord speed. I cant play any opener/all in without them knowing in advance.

My solution is remove swarmhost and get zerg a cool other unit in replace for example a spellcaster or micro unit.
And lock nydus behind the hive tech and make it cost more.

2019-10-04,,"I agree with most of the comments here, but I wanted to give another perspective.

I'm inclined to believe that your husband is trying by all means to get some sexual variety. I don't agree with how he does it, but the fact is he is very into the idea of having sex with new partners. If he's not into men at all, which is his right, is probably why he wouldn't want a threesome with another man.

So the real issue is about how you want to consider non-monogamy in your couple. The desire to have sex with different partners is a very natural desire, and most people at one time or another of their lives will feel that need. Whether or not we act on those needs is entirely our choice, and as a couple, it is a decision you should take together. 

 #x200B;

So in short:

There's no rules about what a threesome should be (it could be 3 men, or 3 women, and it's still a threesome)

There's also no ""normal"" when it comes to group sex, as each situation is unique and everyone is unique

Saying it's different for men is utter bullcrap.

And personally, having children doesn't make it weird - you don't involve your kids in your sexual activities at ALL, so it doesn't matter.

I think phoenix collossi was the meta a few seasons ago.

BUT if you ask such questions im assuming you are diamond at max but probably lower.
I wouldnt suggest you to play it since its very hard to constantly pressure/scout/harass with Phoenixes to make them worth and it only takes a couple of marines and a widow mine to lose them all.

Micro should have your least priority.
Thats a mistake many low league Player do.
You guys think good Player micro like a mad man.
But i can tell you in Master you dont realy micro aswell unless its a super hard all in where you have nothing else to do anyway.
I think the difference in terms of micro from a low league Player to a master + player is not nessary the skill to micro its more they know when they can micro and if its worth to micro.
For example lets see it from a terran perspective since you mentioned that you play terran. Lets say you drop someone. What low league player do is constantly watch the drop that they can safe  the medivac +mm.
What master+ do is shift que the command for the medivac if its close to drop they check if its safe to drop and macro meanwhile and they only swap back if they finished with the macro stuff they wanted to do or if they see the attack announcer on the minimap or units which move to the drop. Its over simplified here there is a bit more to it and its situational but thats overall the differnce. And  you can come diamond easily by just f2 a moving if your build is decently enough executed and i dont mean hitting every timing on the exact second more like building things in order and in a certain time window.
And you can trust higher league players when they say you dont need micro or other stuff cuz its true if they would smurf they could literaly a move you without micro cuz every thing else is more important than micro. You can start microing once you get master and only if you ""perfected "" the rest of the mechanics and builds.",6549,None,16:56:14

Firstly, I've had such feelings at various stages of my life. I can tell you what helped ME, doesn't mean it'll work for you, but it's something you might explore. When I shifted my focus from ""wanting to share my sexuality with others"" to ""wanting to have a sexuality with myself and others"", it helped me get past the mental block that I had. I think it's because I felt my sexuality needed validation from others, as since others didn't have an interest in my sexuality, I felt like I also should not have an interest in it. When I started to accept that my sexuality was my own, and not dependent on other's opinions, I felt like I became a much better lover, both to myself, and to others.

Also, you just got out of a relationship, so feeling like no one will ever be interested in you is a common reaction. However, I'd recommend just focusing on wanting and accepting who you are, and you'll see others will eventually want and accept you as well. It all starts with yourself!

It's not because it is presented as science, that it is proper science. The data may be right, but the conclusions we reach with it is often a matter of interpretation. For instance, it's possible that people who've had more previous relationships are generally less happy - but does it mean it is caused by the amount of partners, or the ability to be more critical of your relationship because it's not your first rodeo?

2019-11-12,Question on York Boys Cross Country - Illinois,"33yo here, former Illinois high school cross country runner. 

I see that York recently placed a rather impressive third (153 points) in the boys state championship race, although the team was a considerable margin from 1st (64 points) and 2nd (68 points).

I was surprised to see that the York boys haven't won a state championship since the fall of 2012, this after winning dozens of titles in the decades prior.

Clearly a team that finishes third in state isn't 'struggling' by any means. The boys should be very proud of their accomplishments.

But does anyone have any theories as to why they're no longer dominating? Have other schools caught onto their training methods? Has the loss of Joe Newton meant lower turnout for the team (and thus a lower pool of potentially great runners)? Any other causes?",9634,None,20:28:22
2019-11-12,The University of Illinois is last in the Big Ten at 'Twitter Followers Rate',"Mid-30s here. I grew up in the Chicago suburbs. Small school alum. I grew up the child of parents who graduated from another Big Ten school. All my neighbors cheered for various universities (something quite opposite of what I saw when visiting relatives in Indiana). Compared to my teenage years, I now have a much greater appreciation of what a remarkably outstanding university that UIUC is.

And yet .... (dramatic pause) .....

a belief that still holds from my high school years is this: compared to other Big Ten schools, people aren't particularly excited about being University of Illinois students.

The huge football win on Saturday got me thinking about school spirit at the University of Illinois. I was surprised how few comments there were on a popular Illini blog. And I remembered a friend recently saying that there are seemingly way more Chicago bars for other Big Ten schools compared to the number of bars for the Illini.

A post on this subreddit a year ago, ""Lack of school spirit"", raised a similar question. The OP mentioned, "" When I visited my friends at other big 10 schools, they had dedicated traditions and an overall feeling of cohesion that you just dont experience at UIUC. From my experience, people here view UIUC as not something particularly special or even a place they are really proud of attending. "" As someone else noted, "" I was at U of I in 2011 when we were 6-0, and Block I STILL wasn't even close to full. Compare that to any other big ten school that's student section is literally packed to the walls every game.""

I think that there are a few reasons that school spirit might be lower at Illinois compared to other schools:

* More than any other Midwest city, Chicago draws a much higher number of out-of-state transplants. Chicago gets alums from Purdue / Iowa / Indiana / Michigan / Michigan State / Wisconsin in a way that no other city does. A relatively large proportion of future University of Illinois students grow up in households cheering for other universities, and then before they know it, they find themselves as University of Illinois students. They might cheer for the Illini while at school, but probably not with the same intensity as someone who grew up in greater Detroit (UM/MSU) or Columbus (OSU) or Indy (PU/IU) or Minneapolis (UMn) or Omaha (UN).
* Illinois (60%) has a higher acceptance rate than Northwestern (10%), Notre Dame (18%), Michigan (28%), Minnesota (44%), Wisconsin (52%), Ohio State (54%), or Purdue (56%). Is there a significant amount of Illinois students that wish that they were at another university?
* Apart from Penn State (home to arguably the most famous football coach in college football history, and one of the most famous stadiums), no Big Ten U is located further from its state's biggest city than UIUC is from Chicago. This distance greatly disincentives traveling back to the university to attend sporting events or activities.

I wanted to get some numbers around school spirit. One way to do it is to see how likely its alumni are to follow the school's official Twitter account. Using alumni figures from LinkedIn and follower counts on the Twitter account, I came up with a percentage which shows the ratio between the number of followers of the school's official Twitter account divided by the number of alumni of that school. I'm aware that non-alumni can of course follow a school's Twitter account, but this is the best sentiment that I could come up with for the time being. From my quick glance, I didn't find 'social media strategy' to be a meaningful factor. The U of I account has plenty of interesting tweets per day.

Ohio State, with 331k Twitter followers at 313k alumni (per LinkedIn), led the list at 106%.

Illinois, 80k Twitter followers and 307k alumni (per LinkedIn) was last in 'follower rate' among the fourteen schools of the Big Ten, at a measly 26%.

So what are your thoughts? Why do you think that Illinois is last on this list? Why, even in good times for football, is the student section much less crowded than it is at other schools? Is there anything that U of I can do to make its students love its school more?

2019-11-13,,"Thanks for the comment. Since making that post I have been doing great I haven't gambled once except for when I went to bingo (team work thing) which I guess is technically gambling but it was something I had never done before and I don't have an urge do it again however I must point out I did have a strong urge to go to the casino straight after bingo luckily I couldn't get there. 

My only concern is getting caught off guard, being complacent and ending up going to the casino but I'm not going to think of that and focus on the positives. Since using gamstop I haven't even attempted to gamble online and I don't go to the bookies so I'm going in the right direction.

2019-11-15,,"I don't like Roselia.

There. I said it. *I don't like Roselia*. AAAAAAGH.

I've tried with them. I really have. I even expected to like them best, because I love their image and I've been into visual kei since I was... a lot younger than I was now, and yet here I am: a PasuPale fan. Folks, I just can't do it.

Let's start with their music. It's superficially polished, but I can't get into it. To my ears it's lacking something. I'm the kind of person who listens to songs I love over and over - don't ask me how many times I've heard *Yura-Yura*, but it's a lot - but nothing original Roselia have ever done grabs me like that. I bought their album fully expecting to get a lot of replay value out of it: hasn't happened. It's all just deeply *okay* and very, very one-note - not so much a group that's found a niche as one that's stuck in a rut. I remember a recent WW Roselia original starting off softer and slower, which made me prick up my ears for once... but as soon as the intro was done it was straight back to business as usual. I lost interest right there. Now that I mention it, though, I wonder if maybe this is *because* I was into visual kei before? I know what this genre can do, and Roselia just ain't doing it.

Secondly? The characters. I don't feel it. Sayo, admittedly, has grown on me and she's now easily one of my favourites, but I never got on with Yukina and the other three are becoming less interesting to me as time goes on, not more. In the band stories, Lisa increasingly feels like she's there to prop up Yukina and that's it, and as for Yukina herself, she just *grates* on me. I honestly feel like her friendship with Lisa, like the fondness for cats, has been pasted awkwardly onto a character who otherwise strikes me as stiff and unlikeable, in an attempt to make her immediately more sympathetic. Yukina also, to my eyes, has fatally bought into her own hype. She doesn't seem to judge herself anywhere near as harshly as she does everyone else: if I could believe that she did, I'm sure I'd like her more. Yukina, to me, reads as arrogant and not confident, and the game writing often seems to me to treat her as perfectly justified in thinking she's just *better* than everyone else... it's not a look I like. The only way she seems to have changed to me is in managing to go from 'I'm just better than all of you' to '*We're* just better than all of you'... never mind that Poppin'Party are far more musically diverse and Pastel*Palettes are actual professionals. I'm sure other people feel differently, but I just can't see it myself.

Though the game also talks about how Ako is maturing and Rinko is growing into herself, I just don't see it - or, more to the point, I don't feel like the game has convincingly shown me it. It's not like this kind of development never happens: Sayo is a fantastic example of it, and Chisato and Ran have both noticeably grown, too. When they told me Ran had matured beyond the rest of Afterglow in their second band story, I *believed* it - because I could *see* it. I can point to concrete examples of Sayo and Chisato handling themselves differently in later-game content than they did at the start. Ako? We've just been told she has, and are expected to be on board with it even though she *acts* basically identically. 

It's much the same with Rinko: her growing confidence feels to me like an informed attribute. She talks to more people, yes, and she does more things... but none of that is reflected in the way she conducts herself, and her actual characterisation feels static. She's doing more things, but she's doing them *exactly like Act 1 Rinko would*, and mostly because she's been revealed to be unexpectedly good at them all along. I'd really like to see her truly leave her comfort zone to do something she *isn't* already good to great at and just needs to take more confidence in, but that doesn't seem to be happening for her. The school club event and its Status Quo Is God ending was a waste of a potentially interesting avenue for character development... though even there we had to sit through *another* instance of Rinko Is Unexpectedly Good At Something with the tennis club, so I guess I should be thankful she didn't just join the Tennis Club.

Sayo is amazing, though, so there's that much. Now to slog through another painful Versus Live event because she got the three-star. Sigh.",8139,None,20:44:01

2019-11-17,Childhood trauma and gambling,"Hello,

A quick introduction; Im in my thirties, and have been gambling free since May 25th 2018. At my bottom, I lost my career, my house, my marriage, my friends, and most importantly, my self esteem and my desire to live.

Since then Ive been to therapy, and decided that I had enough of this. I left my field of work and studied to become an addiction therapist.

In my last class of my diploma, which was on Mental Health, we explored how every single one of us has some form of childhood trauma, or love deficiencies in our childhood. Everyone does. And that often shapes some personality traits (and for some it evolves into personality disorders). Ive just realised that as a kid, I really just wanted someone to play with me. I was going to school in another town, so I was the stranger at school, and in my neighbourhood. Only child. My dad worked hard, and my mom disliked playing with kids. 

So I played alone, and I think I cut myself from these emotions as a child, because it hurt too much. Every game I liked as a child and as a teenager all involved some financial gain, some material component, and I never played for the fun of the play (I cut myself from my emotions about play). I think this translated into my gambling, maybe because I could do it without the emotions that go with gambling your life away, maybe because I finally felt something.

I thought I had explored everything in therapy, and I see now that its rarely as simple as it seems. Still not gambling, and cut from my life all games which had a financial component. Im much happier now.",9911,Help Seeking,22:53:25

2019-11-18,,"For me, I dont think this was it. It might explain why it was gambling and not drugs or alcohol though. It might explain some of the emotional inaptitude that made me unable to cope with life as I was living it.

The urges are mostly gone, but its in most part thanks to having stopped gambling and not allowing me to even entertain the idea of gambling. Once thats out of the way (usually after 3-6 months of abstinance), the urges stopped for me. However I was still (and still am today!) at risk because my emotional issues are still there. Urges could come back if I stop using the tools Ive learned to manage my emotions and if I stop having a balanced life.

2019-11-20,Bout to start NoFap,"Hi all

I was hoping you could help. I'm looking to adopt the NoFap lifestyle mainly because I think I masturbate too frequently and I definelty see the negative impact it has on me such as low energy and always being tired. 

Now Ive done NoFap before with the intention of just wanting to masturbate less and lasted about a week before going back to the usual routine. 

I want this to become something I can achieve consistently and long term. I've had a look through this sub and found lots of useful information as well as doing some research and watching YouTube videos. My only issue s I don't know where to start to ensure this is something I succeed with in the long term and not just something that I try for a few weeks. 

I've seen that porn is the s probablyy the first thing that needs to stop but is there any other advice for a beginner? .  like the meditation side to use your sexual energy in a different way? And semen retention, these are just things I have come across

Also does no fap mean just no masturbating should kd sex also be avoided? 

I'm just looking for some advice on how to start all of this

2019-12-28,,Have seen numerous  high rollers lose everything and sometimes never be seen or heard from at casino again. Generally only a matter of time ... unless you have  bill gates type of money.  I know most of the dealers at my local casino and used to ask them what happened to so and so that was a  high roller usually no one knows. My guess is they went broke or are embarrassed to be seen playing small stakes.  Have watched people go from betting 5-10k a hand  to playing at the 5$ tables. Or high limit slot players now playing penny or quarter slots.  A lot of them take out markers that they cant pay back to casino.  So they forced to avoid the place or have maybe even been banned from the property.  Also once  the  high rolling player goes broke. The casino comps will also disapear almost instantly. The casino has no use for you anymore. The host may not even answer your phone calls anymore and will have every excuse to not give you a comp anymore.  The host is not a friend at all. Simply there to keep you around until your bankroll exhausted.  Gosh these places are disgusting.  !  Lets stay away friends. One day at a time,4884,None,09:46:25

I'm seeing quite a few day 1 / relapse posts and I all I want to say to everyone is please believe it is possible to live a better life. For those of you currently in a tough situation I understand it may seem like there is no light at the end of the tunnel, I've been there, but there is and it will just take time if you're really commited to stopping.

I've still got a long way to go to make up for all the years I wasted away, but I'll tell you one thing even after a short amount of time stopping you will start feeling much better, more motivated and start enjoying the thing you used to. Personally I've started playing football and going to the gym again, things which when I was at my worst I had lost all interest in. I used to just about eat food so I didnt feel hungry, my faviourite meals I didn't even enjoy because of the sick feeling and guilt I had when I knew I had messed up. 

When I get time to reflect, its funny how the things I worry about now are not going to the gym for a week whereas before I would not be able to sleep thinking about how I was going to pay bills. Don't get me wrong I'm still in debt but I know that there is now a way out I will achieve what I want to achieve albeit it will be a lot longer than what I imagined it would.

I want to keep myself grounded and appreciate the small things that come with living a life without wasting money as I think its to become complacent and fool yourself in to thinking everything is good. I will continue to focus on striving for more each day and becoming the person I want to be.

When youre under 24, but especially under 18, your brain neurological pathways develop more intensely and stronger than older. Thats normal, its made so your formative years are actually formative, and that brain elasticity goes away gradually until your mid 20s.

All that to say, that while winning money can be great, the swings you experienced can lead to dangerous habits, or a poor relationship with money. At 15 I could not have seen it, but after losing my job, my wife, my friends, and crazy amounts of money at 30, I definitely see it now.

I strongly believe its important to seek support in person, and to try online support tools when you feel less fragile. When youre able to be critical of what you encounter, and decide if it aligns with your values or not, its less triggering, in my experience anyway.

so my question is about the VFR and its 60 hz Animations. Ive read nothing more about it no complains no nothing. Only about the audio which is odd. I dont want to discuss the reasoning why the vfr is they way it is or if you actually need it that way. Ive played arround 100h on halo reach on pc now and i had to stop. Not only for the Framerate but mostly. Ive 200fps+ and the Game just doesnt feel smooth it feels clunky due to the 60hz Animations and its an absolut dealbreaker for me.I bought the mcc so i can finaly play the halo games (especialy halo 2) with a vfr and smoothness. And when i bought the game they said they fixed the vfr but thats not fix for me. I just want to know if they will ever fix it or can i just deinstall the game and forget about it since i cant play the game like this ? Is there any news related to that?

Tldr; Will they fix the 60hz animations in VFR?",6549,None,01:17:35
2020-01-18,,Thats why im asking since i havent seen any mention in the flight update news. So for me that means they dont see it as a problem rn. Which is shame cuz it is. Framerate and smoothness is basicly everything in a shooter. And lets be real the VFR was basicly the only selling point. Other than that you could play the various other options to play halo on PC.

I've been there before and you feel like such an idiot.

There is only way and that is to stop the gambling which when your in a situation where you have loads of debt no money to buy or pay for anything you think what's the point I may as well gamble to try and win something that will help me out but trust me it never works out. Accept the situation as hard as it is and try focus on anything you can do to get money in, if that means searching for another job, working more hours etc then do it.

No I cant so this time I got rid of all my bank cards only withdraw once every two weeks just limited amount. Told as many people as I could about my problem to keep myself accountable. For me bank card + iPhone= DISASTER of online gambling. Last December lost 6000 in one day. Broke even day before but started chasing 50 lost bet and by the evening lost all my kids savings.

He doesn't get it. He's the most sympathetic person I have ever met who doesn't also have this fucking condition *and he does not get it*. He doesn't get it because to his eyes I absolutely deserve to be able to claim disability benefits. He doesn't get that I'm not just being dramatic when I say this government doesn't care about the disabled. He doesn't get that the system is set up to reject as many applicants as possible and not to facilitate disabled people getting help. He doesn't get that his income, though it's not really enough to support us both in London (it's a decent salary, it's just... *London*), is high enough any financial support I do get is likely to be so paltry it won't be worth the stress of applying, inevitably getting rejected, and appealing in the hope I won't just get rejected again.

He doesn't get that, as someone with a variable condition, the fact that I can sort of function on my good days will be used to deny support for me on the days I can't. He doesn't get that showing up at my doctor and telling her I have lower back pain because weak muscles are weak everywhere will get me nothing but eye-rolling behind my back - here's another fat fortyish female who says she can't work because she's tired and her back hurts sometimes, who'd be absolutely fine *if she just lost weight*. He does not get that going anywhere at all by myself is utterly exhausting and the trip to the doctor's leaves me wiped out and in pain. He doesn't get that my doctor is overworked and overwhelmed, that I am a new patient they have seen all of twice and have no reason to give a shit about helping me with a claim, that they are not the GP who helped me get diagnosed and my last doctor wasn't either. He doesn't get that they may well be one of the multiplicity of clinicians who doesn't believe CFS is a real condition, or really that big of a deal, exactly like the doctors at the surgery I had to leave because they were trying to stop my antidepressants, who didn't even add the CFS diagnosis to my charts until I insisted on it.

He doesn't understand that the onus is put on me to prove I'm disabled, and they will be actively trying to prove that I'm not.

Say she gets her own way, keeps the money, and Milly doesn't get her wig. This means there's a distinct possibility that the bride shows up to her own wedding with a pixie cut.

Cue the questions. Milly, what happened to your hair? From anyone in the bridal party who's not in the loop. From the guests who haven't seen her lately. Did something happen to Milly's hair? I didn't think she was the kind to want to cut all her hair off just before her wedding. Does anyone know what happened to Milly's hair?

And yes, this is going to be embarrassing for Milly. What OP does not seem to have considered is that Milly can reply to those questions. Her family can. Her friends can. Oh, well, you see she was going to wear her hair long, but her idiot cousin who thinks she's a beautician because she did six months of cosmetology school absolutely ruined it trying to put extensions in, so she had to get it all cut off. Oh, what a shame. Oh, poor Milly. Wait, didn't she know she'd only done six months of... well, actually, Cousin Renee talked her into a more expensive option than she'd budgeted for, then talked her into letting *her* do it to 'save money', *then* she convinced her that she knew what she was doing and didn't actually tell Milly she'd never done it before and had just watched a bunch of tutorials on YouTube. And Renee still charged her $600 for it. Really? That's awful. What was Renee thinking?! How could she do that to her own cousin? Hey, isn't that her over there? She's got a nerve showing her face here...

Bet buying that wig would be sounding pretty good by the time the reception started, and they'd still talk even if she had the good sense to stay away. They're gonna be talking about this when she's forty, except she'll have charged her a grand, the wedding will have been the next morning and Milly will have walked down the aisle looking like GI Jane.

Yesterday was just insane, no need to go into the specifics, but I bought a stock, it immediately tanked, I panick sold it, and immediately once I sold it it more than doubled (stock ticker MYO for those that are interested to see the history).  I recently ran into a therapist that I saw for gambling when I was 17 or 18 (currently 37) at a wedding, and I felt such shame that I was dealing with this 20 years ago, and I'm still dealing with it.  So much damage done, both emotional and financial.  So much lying, not only to loved ones, but to myself.  I'm ready to break out of the disease.  I recently started with a therapist and he's been very helpful.  I'm ready to dedicate my time and money towards my family.  I'm ready to start paying off my debts.  I'm ready to be happy.  I'm ready to be at peace.  I'm ready to be calm.  I was blessed with lots of talents, the only thing that can really stop me is myself, and boy am I good at doing that.

2020-02-06,,"It really is a huge scam. I dont even believe slots only keep 10% of the money they take in. A lot of casinos now lease their slot machines so that means they have to pay lease company, Then a lot of these high tech slot machines cost a fortune and factor in if its a themed one like  game of thrones  whatever theme is sponsoring the game they must have to pay royalties.  Then the huge electricity bill to keep 1000s of slots on 24/7 . I just dont see how a casino can make a profit off only keeping 10%. My guess its closer to 25% if not more. Very rarely do you play a 100$ and after that is played you still have 90$ left. I know they will say ohh we pay out some big jackpots everyday ... but I have watched whole areas of machines for 8-10 hours on end and never seen anything close to a good jackpot being paid to anyone.   And ohh by the way if you put 2000$ into the machine and then win a 2000$ jackpot( your money back)  .. Uncle Sam will be waiting for his 30%-40% back.

Things which are easy to do and protect your extra money from yourself:

- Buy a few hundread dollars of gift cards at the grocery you usually go to. You know youll need food, so you can spend that ahead. Its also a good measure if you fall on harder times.

- Pay your rent or your mortgage (if allowed) a few months in advance. You can also double pay all utility bills, and save yourself from having to pay next month.

- Invest in your comfort if you still have extra. Always wanted a new office chair? Or an expensive pillow thats better for your neck? Then do it now. Your well being is very much important, and thats not wasted money like gambling has been for us.

2020-02-13,,"I understand what you're saying; I hear your points. I don't, however, agree with the idea of making make-up *which originally cost premium currency to obtain* cheaper to craft than the base version simply because it has been recolored, because that's not parity. The original wasn't free. It might well not even have been cheap. I don't think assuming a recolor of such an item would be was ever particularly reasonable, never mind likely. I was disappointed that they weren't, too, I would also have liked it if they were. That doesn't mean my desires were practicable.

Cheaper recolors of premium-priced items are going to be unpopular with players whose money is already spent. Consider the complaints Elex faced when they changed the *stats* of a premium item. The only difference was how useful it was to the metagame; the result was massive discontentment and upset from players who - entirely justifiably - no longer felt they'd got what they paid for.

Yes, I totally agree with you that make-up should be made available in a wider range of skin tones - ideally so that unlocking one version gave access to all the others. Make-ups have always been pricey, however, with very few options available if you're not prepared to spend diamonds. It really *isn't* a good move to make recolors of premium makeup an exception to premium pricing, because now people who don't have the original have to pay more for one particular version of the same thing: the version that unlocks the completion rewards. That's also going to make people unhappy. It's also going to be seen as unfair.

Let's look at Moth to Fire, which was initially the penultimate prize from an expensive tiered event. If someone wants the original pale-skinned version of Moth to Fire, crafting it from scratch will cost **at minimum** **761 diamonds**, and that's presuming they're a mid to late-game player who has unlocked the stages required to drop the Fashion Pioneer glasses (five required) *and* has sunk enough gold into the Mystery House gachas to have stockpiled enough of the other premium store items the recipe calls for. If they haven't, that's going to be another 520 diamonds on top of the 761 they already had to find. You could end up paying **1,281 diamonds** to craft the original.

It's definitely annoying, if you've completed all the other crafting requirements, to have to pay 432 diamonds on top of them to get access to the make-up. I know I looked at them and sighed, but it was a pain to have to do that to craft the pale-skinned version too. If the requirements were somehow more stringent for the recolors, I could understand the outcry - but they're not, from what I can see. They're exactly the same. The only way it could get fairer than that is if Elex made them a completion prize and gave them out for free to everyone who already had Moth to Fire, and even *then* the original would still be extremely expensive to obtain in the first place.

What are the alternatives to identical recipes? Make the other makeups alternate colorways? You'd still need to craft the original to have it to dye, and still need multiple if you wanted them all. Give the recolors all out for free, to everyone? The original still costs 1,281 diamonds on top of all the gold store items and drops you need. Should the original be free too, then? Nikki's Info says nearly 40% of their users paid full price, one way or another, for Moth to Fire already. Would *that* be fair?",8139,None,15:46:32

We're all of us playing in someone else's yard.

Im at around 6 months I think  and I just wanted to share this with all of you as I know when I first started off I didn't think this was possible. I don't really count days but try and go a day at a time and when you get to certain length of time it's not always at the forefront of your mind so I shift my thinking to other things I want to improve in my life like going the gym more etc which is great. 

I come back and visit this sub regularly because I think it's easy to slip up if you don't remind yourself of the state you were in before and also to look at how far you've come.

From my experience putting up barriers is one of the most important things and the other which I'm still working on is not to just act on impulses and think everything is OK now. I need to remember what it was like, how I would feel, the consequences of my actions to keep moving forward.

I am sharing my story to see if perhaps you can use her as your motivation. View gambling as the disease it is and hate it so much you avoid it like a plague.

2020-02-20,,"That moment where you test your creation, and the potency/effects are consistent with what youre used to and with your math... feels really good.

6g of bud
.75g of hash

100 ml of coconut oil

Edit: Yes, I may be off by 20-25%. But if I was off much more than that, a measured dose wouldnt be similar in potency as the lab tested edibles Im used to taking (I usually need 20-30mg)",9911,None,15:04:13
2020-02-20,,"Sure! That way Ill have it written for myself too haha!

Oven at 250 F

Place organic matter in a mason jar, seal it, put it on a hand towel placed on a baking sheet in the oven for 30-40 minutes, shaking the jar every 10 minutes. (This transforms THCA into THC) Once ready, weed looks lightly toasted, still has some green hues but looks a bit brownish.

Using oven mitts/gloves/something to not burn yourself, open the jar, pour melted coconut oil (calculate the potency to know how much to pour, math explained below), seal the jar again.

Few inches or water in a pot, bring it to almost a boil. You WILL need a candy thermometer or a way to know the temperature of the water, youre aiming to keep it between 180 F and 190 F. Once you figure out a stove setting that gives you water around that range and its pretty stable, put the mason jar with the oil infusing with the weed into the water. 2 hours of cooking, shake the jar vigourously every 10-15 minutes (again, protect your skin the jar is hot).

Take it off the stove, wait for it to cool, and voila.

EDIT: Wait! I was high, I forgot to say: pour the slightly cooled yet still liquid oil into another mason jar, using a cheesecloth as a filter to catch the plant matter. Squeeze the gathered herbs as much as you can, to get as much as the oil out, and discard the cheesecloth.

Math section:

If youre using plant with 20% THC, that means once decarboxylated, you get 200 mg per gram of bud you used. Calculate how many theoretical mg you have, and divide by how many ml of coconut oil you used.


Example: 
6g 20% bud = 1200 mg THC
100 ml of oil

Potency: 12mg/ml

Ive done the math with other sources of edible product, and even when comparing to the cheapest Solei oil at 35$ for 15ml of 25mg/ml (around 0.09$ per mg of THC), mine came out at 0.03$ per mg of THC, so 3 times cheaper.

When you take it - be sure to eat it with something that contains lechitin. Meats, cheese, peanut butter - its in lots of things, you can google it to find a source. If you dont, it might take longer to get absorbed in your system.

Hope this helps, let me know if anything isnt clear!",9911,None,15:22:42

I can tell you it takes 4 times as much to feel something and the high isnt the same.

With fresh bud, tested bud which you know the % of THCA in it, you know how many milligrams of THC you can extract from it. 1g of 20% THCA equals 200 mg THC.

I used to work in healthcare. One of the things I had to be trained on every single year just to sit at a Reception desk was safeguarding, and the various ways in which vulnerable adults could be abused, and 'abuse' takes in a far wider spectrum of sins than many people seem to realize. I'm glad you realize neglect is a form of abuse. Guess what? **Financial abuse is also a real and recognized form.** I've seen people turn in safeguarding reports and get social services involved after vulnerable adults were financially abused by their 'friends'.

You guys had Power of Attorney over your vulnerable aunt. Your father was always *supposed* to be doing all the shit your family (apparently belatedly) did to secure appropriate care for her, so you don't actually get brownie points for that. Your family, however, sold your aunt's property and enriched yourselves. You say it was only $75, but that money should still have gone back to her, or been used to fund her care. Your father also did this despite the fact that she clearly is capable of having a say in how it should be disposed of when she's being properly cared for - even in your own words she's made it clear she would have wanted her trike to be sold to the friend who asked and not whatever rando you offloaded it onto. That's financial abuse. Never mind the morality of it all, the *safest* thing to do to cover your own backs would have been to store what could be salvaged and seek her input about what to do with it when she was sufficiently recovered, which she has done. What's more, if any mandated reporter hears about it, they will be *legally obliged* to report it - because if they don't, they'll lose their job.",8139,Recovery,17:30:19

and ofc as a european i only find Servers on NA which gives me a high ping.
And the ping diffrence makes it feel kind of random to hit the shots.Not saying it makes it unplayable but you can definitly feel it.

One thing they got right this time is the fps.
Since im playing on a 144hz monitor it feels smooth which is probably cuz im having 400+Fps.
But i cant play the Camping since the fps animations are still locked on 60hz and it lools terrible.

I've started reading Allen Carr's book again, and spending my free time listening to podcasts, spending more time with the kids and wife, and letting loose.  Can't remember the last time I sat down with my kids to play video games or toss a frisbee, I was too busy gambling.  Most recent memory is when we were at the zoo, and the monkeys were jumping around, and I was watching a football game on my phone, and my boy was just so dissapointed.  It was a crap feeling.  Life for the last 32 days hasen't been perfet.  I have created a major tsunami of financial damage, will take more than 32 days to fix, but at least it's not getting worse.  Work is going well and I find myself generally looser and calmer, despite the financial stress.  Every day for me is a new milestone and a small step in the right direction.

Don't believe that weed has no effect, and one majorly important effect, when you are a teen who's learning about life and about themselves, is that letting your brain get used to instant gratification with any substance creates a dangerous precedent. It tends to make your pliable, still forming brain, believe that there's nothing like taking a substance of any kind to make you feel good. An adult brain can understand the risks and can understand that even if it feels good, you can't do it all the time, many times a day. I work in addiction therapy, and most of my hardcore drug addicts all learned ""the trade"" with weed very early on.

Addiction is a mental illness, like depression is a mental illness, and anxiety disorders, and many other things that touch almost everyone.

Everyone suffers pain and trauma, as a child, and then as adults. We all have to cope with it however we find that works for us. Those of us who learn to deal with their emotions responsibly, thats great, but most of us dont. Most of us use something as a coping mechanism, or strategy, and those will sometimes be mostly be harmless for some, or riddled with consequences for others.

Psychotropes addiction is one such consequence that comes after using any psychoactive chemical as a coping mechanism.

This isnt what I believe in, its what science tells us in mental health studies. Hope this helped!

And they have a convenient cancel withdrawal button availAble that they figure will tempt you til the last possible moment they may decide to send a check.

I think if my mindset was not to gamble because i'll lose, I would have broken by now ... deep down, believe it or not, after 20 years of losing, I still think I can beat the market.  I've therefore gone away from using that as my ammunition against gambling.  Instead, i'm choosing a life with less stress and anxiety.  The last few weeks have been very zen for me ... market all over the place, up and down like 5% per day, i'm sure suicide rates aroudn the world are up, and here I am playing board games with my kids and watching netflix with my wife.  

If I trade, i might win, I might lose, I don't care either way.  I'd rather be a non gambler and scrape aside a few bucks every month, than be a gambler who's on the brink of jumping in front of a train every single day.

Im a main Midlaner who plays yasuo, diana and ahri.

So what ive experienced, when im playing mid and see the enemy midlaner roaming i usualy shove the wave and go for tower plates since i dont want to get catched offguard on the way and if they see an opportunity it is probably gonna end bad for me so most of the time i pref to just 2x ping missing enemy on mid and after that 2x to be carefull on the lane hes most likely to roam to.

But i can ping as much as i want in 80% of the games i get spampinged from lets say my botlane
who say something like ""why no ss?"" and then i say something like ""i did 4 times "" but usualy they follow it with ""why not follow u are so bad"".
So no matter how much i ping they will blame me for it after they die. And if i follow we usualy all die or at least some of us die in a unwinable fight.

The difference between a person who is undergoing a lengthy, unpleasant treatment that might not bear fruit and an animal who is doing the same is not just that the animal cannot consent for themselves. It's that the animal has no concept of the future. They don't know why they're hurting, and they can't reason with themselves that - if things go well - this might one day be worth it. All animals can understand is that they're in pain, that they can't do the things they enjoy, and nothing makes them happy any more. They have no reason to believe this will change.

This isnt an argument not to treat a pet: far from it. Quality of life, though, is likely to be far more relevant to an animal who relies on their keeper to be acting in their best interests than life at any cost. If there's no realistic chance that an animal can get better, if the chances of them recovering to live the life they love are slim to nil, then sparing them any further pain is really the kindest, most compassionate thing that you can do for them.",8139,None,11:16:28

Vow to be better people and magically shape up?

Yes, I know being fat is unhealthy. Yes, I know I need to lose weight. Fat women are not unaware of this even if they're with people who like their body type. I would say that I despair over how disgusting I feel art least twice every waking hour. But I'd honestly rather you thought I was vaguely attractive anyway, than have yet another person patronizingly pity me for something *I cannot actually control*. No, I can't. I was actually slightly slimmer than average before my health tanked, I became physically incapable of leading an active lifestyle, and I ended up on a bunch of medication that *all* causes weight gain. I am fat because I am ill, not ill because I am fat. It happens. People are fat for all kinds of reasons - not just because they're deliberately choosing to live unhealthy lives. Try talking to us.

No, of course you shouldn't want your perfectly healthy girlfriend to gain weight. That's absolutely ridiculous.

Anyway so i stopped playing after release of reach in the hope they will fix it over time. Still not fixed yet.
 My hope was that it be fluent on a vfr with the h2a release.
Dont flame me i just cant play like this with the low hz animations im getting headache.
id love to play the games but i just cant bother the animations.

Every day one is another step in the recovery process, and every day one I have to have a better plan to ensure there are no more day ones.  Here's what I'm going to do different this time:
1. Reading Carr's 'Easy Way' again
2. Going to post on here daily feelings about each day.   Each update might be a sentence or two, as long as I'm checking in.
3. Started attending phone GA meetings, going to try at least 1 meeting per day. 
4. Remember that I'm not quitting because I don't want to lose anymore money.  That doesn't work for me.  I'm amazing at convincing myself, despite millions of times that have proven otherwise, that I can actually beat the system.  So quitting, because I'm going to lose, doesn't work for me.  I'm quitting because I hate the stress. I hate the anxiety.  I hate being angry.  I hate, more than anything, regret.  I love being proud of myself.  I love feeling like I've accomplished something.  I love spending time with my family without having to be on my phone every single second.  I love knowing that I'm in G-ds hands, and He does not want me to gamble.

2020-04-09,Mad Men - historical accuracy moment,"I think that one thing that many people appreciate about the show is its fidelity to historical accuracy. So I was amused when double-checking a niche event from S5E4 ('Signal 30') to discover that it actually had taken place.

The scene featured Lane Pryce at a NYC bar with his fellow Brits in the summer of 1966, watching England play West Germany (Cold War!) in the 1966 World Cup Final match, a 4-2 win for the home team at London's Wembley Stadium.

Skeptical, I thought, ""The World Cup on American TV in 1966? Really? In an age when hardly any American cared about soccer, and only three networks were even likely to carry it?""

Sure enough...

""The first American coverage of the World Cup consisted only of a [previously filmed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinescope) telecast of the [1966 Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_FIFA_World_Cup) on [NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC). The Final was aired before their coverage of the Saturday [*Major League Baseball Game of the Week*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Game_of_the_Week). NBC used the [black   white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_white_television) [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Broadcasting_Corporation) feed and aired it on a two-hour film delay. This was the first time soccer had been shown in the United States as a stand-alone broadcast.""

All things considered, a two-hour tape delay in 1966 was a rather impressive feat, given that there would be no cell phones, etc., to spoil the result of the match.

Interestingly, Canada began broadcasting the World Cup in 1954, and Mexico began broadcasting the World Cup in 1958.",9634,None,17:30:55

In December lost 6000 in one day betting on football matches. Didnt sleep for two weeks was an absolute mess of myself. Go to work without and desire to do anything crying in the toilet looking at myself in the mirror and asking Why did am I doing this to myself and my family. That how compulsive gamblers brains work without giving you an answer why do we destroy everything around us. What I have done and it helped so far is separating myself from money.

The only advice I would like to offer, if you'd like, is to be mindful of the fact you are mostly gambling free because of circumstances external to you, according to what you are saying. This is great, but the only way for that motivation to last is to eventually find inner motivation from within.

I called the IRS to setup an appointment on Friday but the local offices are closed due to COVID.  I can courier my return and itin applications to the IRS, but not sure if they will accept, since the instructions were clear that everyone has to be there personally.

2020-04-21,,"This may potentially be *a* cause, but if I had to guess at why it might have happened - and I'm no expert - I'd suspect it was because it triggered an immune response , which all vaccines do by default. I and many others with the condition are too old to have received the vaccine, so if it has triggered the condition, it's got to be in company.

I'd hesitate to read too much into the article, since it's a case report and therefore it isn't proof of a clear-cut established link between the vaccine and CFS. Case reports, in medical literature, aren't even really *research*: they're simply reports of something the author observed in practice. They are produced when doctors come across individual patients who present with symptoms that *possibly* suggest something novel is going on. This is done with the hope or intention of spurring further research into the matter so that it can be established if there is one. Think of it as the medical version of finding a dead canary in a coal mine.

On reading through, I noticed that the paper's authors raise the probability that this is a case of correlation, but not causation. The most infamous example of correlation being erroneously assumed to be causation also involves vaccines: the claim that the MMR vaccine causes autism. No causative link has ever been found. The MMR vaccine simply happens to be administered during the window where young children are first diagnosed with autism. In this case, something similar *could* be happening: this teenager *may* have had the conditions already, and the symptoms may simply have been only noted shortly after she had been vaccinated for HPV. Hence the call for more research.

Case reports are the very first baby step on the road to establishing the existence of a new condition, or the existence of a problem with a common treatment. By their very definition, they deal with things that are unusual and haven't been brought up before. It's definitely worth keeping an eye on, but it's not worth losing any sleep over yet.",8139,None,23:29:18

2020-05-05,,"Try Malzahar hes a solid pick. Its super easy to farm with him after you got your first item. Im always having the most cs or beeing even with the adc.
You dont have skillshots. You have a shield which absorbs a skillshot from an enemy so you can get hit a few times in the laneing phase.
You can shove lanes super easy with just your e, w , q combo. 


Pros :
Super easy to farm with and thats usualy the most important thing in low elo at least a  big factor.
The passive shield can save your ass a lot of times. 
You can farm safly without having to commit. With your e and w.
You can basicly 1 hit poeple with your e,w , q, r combo and you can ignite while casting the R.
With the mana cdr build you never have to worry about mana when you got the first item.
And its super easy to do high dmg with him.

Cons: After they poped your shield you are super weak. you dont have burst. You cant realy engage 1vs1 without your ult. Only harassing. 


But since you asked for a simple champ id totaly suggest you playing malzahar. You have to focus on your macro instead of flashy plays and you can totaly punish enemies for misposition.
He is super straight forward and you have to play cautios with him. But thats basicly the elements you need to learn to improve and climb the ranks.

2020-05-06,Why do QOL Changes dont get a higher priority?,"When i read that they will bring halo fianly to the pc i was all hyped about it. Even tho its 10 years to late.
And i still wonder how a USP of 1 game franchise could actually work.

Anyway, So i waited almost a year till the release and then i read they would remove the VFR for release. God bless you released it with the VFR. BUT it wasnt VFR its basicly 60/30fps locks with extra steps.
It absolutly hurt my eyes when i played it since im used to 144hz+ ( with 144hz+ animations). Anyway i thought you guys might had to do a compromise and  release it that way since microsoft forced you to take the christmas market. I mean fine sure whatever. Beside that there where many other issues like sound, mouse input and even gameplay decisions like the controller auto aim.

Its 2020, and you still want to market the super old halo franchise. But lets  be real here. And im not trying to hate on the Developers im sure they are doing their best.

-144hz is standard
- Audio should work just fine 
-The input device should work just flawlessly
and so on.

Lets say you buy a new car. A good oldtimer you drove in your mid 20s. Good old times. And then there is this Company who is promising to bring it back just as the good old days. So you order one.

The car arrives it has no roof it doesnt have seats and you have troubles turining the wheels.

And you Check the Blogs, Reddit etc and they say they will fix it some day in the future , it has no priority right now but you just want to enjoy a ride with your broken car but instead of fixing they release new broken cars.

Now you are here with your car, sure some may can have fun with this one. But why would you if there are others cars arround which work just fine ?

And lets be totaly real here.
Whats the difference between your released version and a cracked emulated version?
Both had a Playerbase , both run terrible.

If you keeo going like this and focus on releasing games over actually making them work you will lose your playerbase sure there are always some diehard fans. But for me and many others who hoped to get a fresh halo expiernce thats just not enough.

You load a game.
You are from Europe but the game loads you in a game from somewhere west america.
Legeneds say there are other server than American server but they still have to be discoverd.
You are in the game trying to have fun beside the 30/60 hz cap of the animations.
Boom Headshot, you are like wow that was nice.... Boom you die 10 times to this guy and you start thinking wow this guy must be realy good and his aimlock is amazing. 
Turns out he was reaching for his cornflakes while playing on a controller which aims for him.
Its a PC game with NO Crossplay why can you play it better with a controller? 

Id hate to see this game dying since the halo games are super fun but if you keep focusing on releasing instead of fixing the games will be dead in no time. Sure you can have it fixed in 2 years and itll run perfectly fine then, but nobody will actually care by then. And im Tierd to go on reddit or your blog to see you saying that the big factors like VFR and so on just dont have priority but this should have the biggest priority for you.

Another guy said I needed to regrade the outside yard and fix the drainage. I paid to have the yard regraded. It never flooded again after that at least. 
I ended up living with cracked sheetrock and doors that would stick on the frame during the winter for years. Eventually I got divorced and a buyer came through and offered the asking price.

I've always hated being a wage-slave, it is obvious suffering and slavery to work any 9-5 job day after day, spinning the hamster wheel in it's circle, going absolutely nowhere. But the wage slavery is the same as everything else. Life itself is a big hamster wheel. It keeps us running in circles, day after day, but leads nowhere.

I don't want to do anything anymore. Video games feel like a chore, internet eventually gets boring, people are boring, everything is boring. I have money saved from my slave job but if I had 5 times the amount I would be in the same situation. There is nothing here, nothing interesting, nothing engaging. I'm bored out of my mind.

Life is just an empty pointless waste of time, filled with anguish and suffering. It's working through problem after problem, suffering in all manners, surrounded that with episodes of mind-numbing boredom. There really is nothing to do but try to distract yourself in any possible matter, but that gets harder to do as you run out of distractions.

2020-06-02,"starting a new 'which episodes do you skip' thread, since the previous one that I found is closed","I skip absolutely nothing in S1 and S2. 

S1 thoughts: First three are great, I'm 'meh' on 'FVD', 'Crackpots', 'Willis'. 'State Dinner' is spectacular, you really see the caring side of Bartlet. A few 'meh' episodes, but I love 'Lord John Marbury'. A few more meh ('Celestial' is fun), and I really like '20 Hours in Los Angeles' a real real lot (I like it's generally lighthearted feel). A few solid but unremarkable ones. I love the last two episodes of the season ('Lies, Damn Lies' and 'What Kind of Day it Has Been').

S2 thoughts: First two are great, 'Midterms' is extraordinary. Some fine but unremarkable ones after there (the president's dialogue at the start of 'Galileo' is great). 'Noel' is good, if a bit overdramatic. The final ten episodes, starting with 'Bartlet's Third State of the Union' are utterly spectacular. Has any series ever had that stellar of a consecutive 10 episode run? The scenes with a young Mrs. Landingham are my favorite of the series.

S3 thoughts: Sam seems to be greatly overlooked in this season. I find this seaason to be a very stressful and un-fun season. I skip 'Isaac'. 'Manchester' is meh. I don't particularly enjoy any of the investigation episodes. '100,000 Airplanes' is pretty good. I think that 'Night Five' is really really good, but I never liked Amy G. I like 'Night Five' a real lot. I skipped the last several episodes of the season on my most recent rewatch. I think that the ending to this season is way too similar to the ending of season 2 (using music to hammer home a point). I think that using 'Hallelujah' for the Simon scenes was a very cheesy move.

S4 thoughts: '20 Hours in America' is generally good, but again, using music for an overly emotional death scene. Getting quite repetitive here. I really liked 'The Long Goodbye', but I skipped over the election and inauguration episodes. I greatly appreciate 'Angel Maintenance'; it's content to be a tight, focused, not overdramatic episode. Same with 'Evidence of Things Not Seen'. I skip the Zoey episodes.

S5 thoughts: I skip anything Zoey related, way too silly and overdramatic. S5 is fine by me. Nothing too over-the-top for most of it, nothing too overdramatic. No episodes here that I adore. 'No Exit' is actually pretty solid; it's a good one to get to know the characters. 'Gaza' / 'Memorial Day' ... meh. Fine.

S6 thoughts: Hard to find anything positive or negative to say about this season. I never liked Santos. I liked Alan Alda's character and acting quite a lot. 'A Change Is Gonna Come' (episode 7) is of equal quality to the lesser episodes in S1, so I appreciated that. 

S7 thoughts: I didn't particularly like any of the campaign episodes. E11 'Internal Displacement' is a decent in-White House episode. 'Institutional Memory' is fine because it didn't have much to do with 'Santos'. I enjoyed the president's walk through the hallway in 'Tomorrow'. 

So in general, a lot of S6/S7 are skipped. Shocker, I know. But the extremely high quality of the first two seasons makes it all worth it.",9634,Anxiety/Stress,05:50:00

What's my point?

My real point is that for myself, and others who I have spoken to, it's very hard to relate or get motivated from people who are in a different age group and different financial threshold.  Someone mentioned to me that it would be worthwhile to start a sub-group, or a whatsapp group, to folks who are a little older, have access to more cash, have caused more damage in their life, so we can share eachothers stories, relate to one an\other, and most importantly, help one another.  I have an ongoing relationship with someone like that on whatsapp and we chat back and forth every single day to share stories, offer support, be a shoulder to cry on for one another ... it's incredibly helpful.

I read many of the posts here by teenagers and people in their 20s who have lost $500 and feel like their life is over, and I wish I could show them a movie of my life so they could see where the end of the road leads ... 

What's my point?

My real point is that for myself, and others who I have spoken to, it's very hard to relate or get motivated from people who are in a different age group and different financial threshold.  Someone mentioned to me that it would be worthwhile to start a sub-group, or a whatsapp group, to folks who are a little older, have access to more cash, have caused more damage in their life, so we can share eachothers stories, relate to one an\other, and most importantly, help one another.  I have an ongoing relationship with someone like that on whatsapp and we chat back and forth every single day to share stories, offer support, be a shoulder to cry on for one another ... it's incredibly helpful.

I thought it was a great idea so putting it out there ... any of the older (35+) folks who can relate to the above, any interest?",9941,Help Seeking,17:04:36
2020-06-08,I watched 'Mr. Holland's Opus' (1995),"Watched it for the first time yesterday. Not sure why.

Thought that it was decent. Richard Dreyfuss is certainly a very good actor. The wife felt like a pretty invisible character.

I thought it was cool writing to have the football coach and music teacher be friends instead of enemies, the latter of which would have been way more stereotypical.

This came out a year after 'Forrest Gump', so it's hard to tell if the ""60s - 80s/90s"" thing was influenced by 'FG' or not. But I didn't love that the story covered 30 years in just a couple hours. Felt like it would have been better had it just focused on one school year.

2020-06-08,favorite moments of obtuseness from Bill on a podcast?,"listening to a decade old podcast between Bill and Chuck Klosterman and Bill couldn't grasp that Randy Newman's ""I Love L.A."" is clearly a satirical song (""Look at that bum over there, man  
He's down on his knees""). Chuck kept trying to point out that it's clearly a mordant song but Bill kept cutting him off before Chuck had the time to make his point. Bill was certain that this is a completely earnest pro-L.A. song.

It just blows my mind that Bill is so dense that he doesn't get that that song mocks the American dream.

2020-06-08,,"Fair enough ... appreciate the perspective.  To reiterate my point, it was not to exclude anyone.  I understand that a big part of recovery is helping others.  I feel that is a stage you need to get to.  For example, when you're on day 1, your job is not to help others, it's to get help yourself.

I am at the stage where I feel I need help to control my gambling.  I felt that it would be beneficial to chat with people in a similar life situation as me, that's all.  The intention is not selfish, although I guess it comes off that way.",9941,Help Seeking,19:17:30

Once you established that, budget/invest your money wisely instead of gambling and Im sure in a few years youll get that RS or M package.

I had lost everything.

I was in a very dark place that I dont wish upon anyone.

It was either die or fight.

So I fought.

I sought help in every capacity. I openly declared my struggles, fears and losses.

I dove into the mix of rehabilitation. I was counselled and coached.

I began to train Jiu Jitsu relentlessly, lift weights, eat well, and read everything positive that I could find.

I eliminated all negativity.

If it didnt add value to my journey, it was gone.

I focused on fortifying myself all day, every day.

There was a battle cry deep within my soul.

The human spirit is incredibly powerful .

Our belief in whats possible can move mountains.

Regardless of the magnitude of your struggle, this warrior is in you as well.

Nothing is easy.

Profound change comes with immense resistance.

And within this resistance is your freedom, your future and the life you deserve.

Stand back up and enter the coliseum.

This is your life.

Give it everything you have.

2020-06-18,Does life just keep getting worse with age?,"It seems the older I get, the less enjoyment I am getting out of everything.

You know how when you are a kid, you feel like there are new and exciting things to do? You get some new video game or toy, and it's just pure excitement? As a kid, I had hope for my future as well as a much better appreciation for things as they were not yet old and stale. Life still had new things to offer and in my youth, I fell for those things.

Now at 28, I find everything old and stale. Life doesn't offer any excitement whatsoever. It's waking up, slaving at work feeling pissed all day (literally work is concentrated stress for 8 hours), and boredom at night. I don't enjoy anything. As I am getting older my tolerance levels are getting less and less for the constant frustrations of a typical day. What is there to look forward to when work is slavery and frustration, and the things outside of work are boring and unfulfilling? 

Sadly, this is just continuing to get worse in my experience, amplified especially over this last year. I constantly feel crippling despair and desperation over how miserable I am feeling living a life permeated by disappointment and boredom. I realize I am a hamster in a wheel, a slave to society, and I live a hollow shell a life. This is how most people's lives are but they won't admit it. Most people pretend to be happy despite most lives being tedium. We think ""next year"" things will change but they never do. False hope.

Not only this, but I have to mention regrets. As the years pass, I have more and more regrets over past mistakes I have made. It seems this aspect of life gets worse with age. As we live our lives, doors which were once potentially open begin to close and the regrets start to pile up. Guilt is the result of this pain, and it is a constant source of depression and despair.

My life is not only is stupid and meaningless in theory, it FEELS stupid and meaningless in practice. It feels heavy. I'm not going anywhere, everything is the same but my frustration tolerance level just gets lower and lower as the years slowly churn on.",6085,Depression,04:27:58
2020-06-18,,"Hey hope i can help you with the following tipps.
First for your first edit this is pretty good.
I like the cinematics at the beginning even tho its kinda long. Try to mix in some of those cinematics after a few clips. So its get refreshing and you can separate your frags/Matches with it.

Try to play with some colors so it doesnt look like just  a recording with music in the background.

Try some speedramps with the music and snych some highlight shots on the Beat. you can even try to highlight shots in your Audio if you play with the volume or some filter.

Since you got those cinematics what i like in montages or edits the name of your montage tracked in the clip. So the camera flys by but the logo stays in the enviroment. (looks cool and is fairly easy) 

And fill it with more effects but dont overdue it.

Some cool and easy effects: Color Correction/Grading , Speedramp,Chroma shift,tracking and shots synched to the music. And some 3rd Person Footage/ Cineamtics of the enviroment or characters.",6549,None,04:37:56

2020-06-22,Finished my build! What's next?,"Started collecting all hardware needed about 1.5 months ago and finally finished the build this weekend. I made some unconventional choices, for example an x570 Tomahawk board paired with a 3600. But I take pleasure in upgrading my rig during the course of time, so I have my mind set on a 8 or 12 core cpu in the future. The 3600 is just a placeholder for now, but it handles everything with ease. Really happy with the CPU.

 #x200B;

This is the second build I made, my previous one is a i3570k which took me about half a day to install (the Mugen 3 installation was hellish!). This one took only a couple of hours, Noctua is a pleasure to work with.  It seems to become much easier each year to build your own pc. There is so much information available on the web. So to anyone doubting, just do it. This subreddit is really helpful, YouTube etc.

 #x200B;

I did some benchmarking and everything seems to run fine @ stock. I only had two crashes in Assassins Creed and the Division 2, but gaming mode in Dragoncenter seemed to cause it! I need to dive deeper into overclocking.

 #x200B;

Now I am wondering what's next, I installed my old HDD in this case, just so I could keep all the pictures and photos. But it seems a no go to have a HDD in a modern system. So I ordered an additional SSD drive.

 #x200B;

There is only one thing I cannot get to work. I want to sync the RGB on the motherboard with those on the case, but I dont know where to put the rgb header and how to sync it. BeQuiet doesnt give that much information about it.

 #x200B;

Anyway here is list to anywone interested, I think I could have made some more cost effective choices, but I am happy with the result. Thanks everyone for the help!

2020-06-30,US tax question,"First year filing in the US, moved here 9 months ago.  I work in trading (FX) and also do my own trading on the side.  In 2019 I had a trading loss.  

If I file it as a capital loss, I get very little back for it.  Am I able to file it as a business loss, and use that negative income against my employment income.  For example, if I made 100k in my job, and lost 60k trading, can I file that as negative income and then only pay tax on net 40k?  I know that typically the answer would be no, but I actually work in the trading industry and part of my trading is to stay on top of the market and the news, so it really is part of my job.  

Any thoughts are appreciated",9941,None,17:56:54

2020-06-30,,"appreciate your reply.  I know that's the general rule, my question is, do you think it would fly for me to file the 60k trading loss as negative income, instead of as a capital loss, since I work in FX and the loss was in FX.  that would allow me to claim the entire 60k against my income, instead of only 3k.

2020-07-10,Dance Collider - A Disappointment,"Please keep in mind, your milage/opinion may differ, just sharing my own thoughts after slogging through this game for a little while.

I'm a huge music game fan, but this game was a massive let down. There are many times the music notes do not seem in sync with the music and I am just hitting blobs which are somewhat off sync from the actual track. This is not okay for a music game, totally unacceptable - the gameplay feels very loose and it shouldn't. The songs are all very similar and generic. The game overall feels generic to me. Even the tracking has issues as the controller often floats away and I miss notes due to this poor controller tracking. 

I don't find it fun or polished either, and again this is from a huge VR music game fan. The first key to these games is having the beat maps sync really well with the music and that's missing here. That's step one.  It really shows how good Beat Saber is - the gameplay is just miles ahead of this in every way and feels tight and fun. 

Not only that, it's $20 which is overpriced for what it is. You can get many great VR games now for around that price that are so much better. I don't even want to play it anymore, and that's after maybe an hour or two of gameplay. My opinion was better at first, some gameplay elements are interesting but the lack of variety in the music and the loose, off sync gameplay ruins this one for me.

Anyone other opinions? I think this is one of those games you play a few hours, and like many, just forget about it rather quickly because it's just not good. I don't want to play it.

i got a question i basicly stopped playing with the end of 8.1 and started a few days ago again. 
Since in 8.1 the only limting factor was azerite traits and neckless level. I had no problem playing pvp with my alts.

But now ist ilevel,azerite traits , the neckless traits, the cloack and corruptions.

How the hell can i catch up with at least 1 alt ? 
Im playing a dh main for pve and a disc for pvp.
and a bunch of other twinks but i think i can totaly forget about them since there is no way im gonna grind all of this stuff. Which is sad since there only purpose now is placing on rare spawns to get an extra chance of a mount.

Its no problem to do all the farming stufd with my dh but i only play arena with my disc how can i catch up ? Is there any catchup.mechanic im missing?
If its required to farm all those neckless traits,  corruptions and cloack level where i did not find a catchup either i can basicly deinstall the game again. And wait for Shadowlands.",6549,Depression,17:57:50

2020-07-18,Just another Failed Statistic - Me,"So I completely blew up multiple times during my trading. I took several losses that were way too large. Never imagined I would lose the kind of money I did and I failed to control risk as positions ran against me. I actually began trading early on with much lower risk profile but joined a trading room where the stocks traded were much higher in price than I was used to and I just didn't even realize how risky my trading became after months of watching this guy do his thing. This was the beginning of the end for me. I am mentally a wreck.

Winners were always cut quickly to gain profits, and I let the losses  run, hoping they would find their way back. It really hurts. I've always been a frugal guy and never lost money recklessly like this. I wouldn't go to a casino and gamble $100 no joke, but lost over 12K trading. Again, completely unlike me in any way whatsoever, but it's exactly what happened.

It's very hard to cope with. Every day I can't believe I actually allowed it to happen and this was my own outcome. I had a bigger loss, followed by another large loss after maybe a year of hovering around break even. I took some time off because I was emotionally wrecked by what happened. When I came back after a few weeks, same damn thing happened again. Could not believe it. How could that position move against me so quickly and strongly? I took another month away. However, I I dipped my toes back in and started making some money back. Made about half that previous loss back feeling better about things before the rug pull and subsequent loss of all that I made back times two. Just unreal. 

It is literally like any move I make in the markets, they move swiftly and strongly against me and don't let me off the hook. I guess I am trading in the same markets as everyone else, so markets move in ways that are just difficult. In most of these cases, had I held, I would have been up massively but I was fearful to lose more and see the positions really get very far away from me.

2020-07-19,,"Hey, bud, well written post and I can very much understand where you are coming from as Im 32. One day at time, thats all I can say. When it comes to the debt, we all have it from our gambling woes and troubles, but you just got to man up on it and pay it off. Youll feel so much better that you did. Its part of the process of putting this addiction behind you.

Its crazy when we finally wake up one day seeing our reality of what gambling has done to us...years gone by, savings lost, debt accumulated, relationships/friendships squandered, and the overall toll it took on us. We got played playing the game, unfortunately...

Just one day at a time, man. Structure and routine. Eat, train, work, sleep, and repeat. Rewire the brain and callous the mind. Build your position, worth, and value up again. Hard work and all out effort starting now and until the good Lord calls you home. In between all that distance, the only thing that you will get from hard work and effort is RESULTS. Point, blank, and period. Loving the process aint easy, but eventually it will start loving you back.

What separates us is transformation, the possibility of change, the desire to evolve, the passion to get up off the ground and stop eating dirt. If I always do what Ive always done, Ill always be where Ive always been....Im gonna grab that baggage and throw it behind me.

You are aware of your potential and know you have purpose. Dont let this addiction and these last years define you. There is nothing to be ashamed of. Everybody in this world is battling their own shadow in some shape or form. Its all about growth. On the other side of all this pain and suffering, there is reward.

After some time of sobriety, I had a rough two months of gambling recently, and last gambled yesterday. Back to being broke, having about a full months worth of income to pay back to bookies over the next few months. 

Came clean to my parents earlier this afternoon. Went to a phone meeting this afternoon, first time in a few months that Ive gone to any sort of meeting. Aware that a sponsor would be highly beneficial. 

I feel like Im just spouting off what I intellectually know is right (I hope to never gamble again), but I feel like Im being a phony. I feel like once my life stabilizes and I have some money in my account, Ill do what I always do, and start gambling again

I feel like Im full of crap when I say things in meetings. I feel like Im just lying to people in the rooms when I say that I want to get sober so that I can get others off of my back and eventually give myself the space and freedom to gamble again.

I completely believe that the wounded child inside of me never wants me to gamble again. But I feel like my addict self is just playing the phony sobriety game for the time being. 

For those that might have experienced what Im feeling, how do you handle times when your wounded, mentally ill brain tells you that youre being a phony when you makes claims about desiring sobriety?

Then the dealer even with a bust card will pull a 6 card 21. Since casinos closed during the covid madness I have given up playing and hope to not ever return.

2020-07-29,"for the harder to understand cases .... questions for the children of parents who *did* the right actions, but something was still missing...","Mid-30s guy here, grew up the youngest of 3. I think that a lot of my problems stem from, among other things, the fact that by the time that I was born, my mom (who has a fairly short temper) was so overwhelmed raising my two older siblings and working part-time that she didn't have the patience to give me the attention that I needed when I was young and upset. My dad worked a typical 9-5, but was otherwise pretty quiet. Both parents went to all of my sporting events, helped me with homework, etc. There wasn't any explicit abuse (physical / sexual / verbal). My parents often told me, ""I love you"", etc. Always threw nice birthday parties for me, drove me to my friends' houses to hang out with them, etc.

Because my parents did so many of the above-mentioned things correctly, I have a hard time coming to grips and understanding the pain that's always been inside of me.

If I think about what still hurts me, it's the fact that there were so many times in my childhood where I would get upset or throw a temper tantrum, etc., as children tend to do. And rather than my mom comforting me and helping me to work through whatever frustration I was feeling, she would instantly send me to my room, telling me how bad that I was acting, shame me, etc. 

I feel like she also had a very high need for approval for me. So if I said something mean or hurtful to her (again, as growing children tend to do), she would take it \*very\* personally, and make it very clear to me how upset she was, and almost force me to feel shame about how I hurt her feelings and make me apologize repeatedly.

There was also one incident in the 4th grade where she caught me reading a ""dirty book"" at the library. Rather than understand that that's what the mind of 10 year old boys are interested in, and having a mature conversation with me, she shamed me for looking at it and made me admit it to my dad at the dinner table. In hindsight, that shaming ritual was very very strange.

I'm not particularly close to her. I play nice and have fairly bland phone calls with her and my dad from time to time. She still does objectively nice things, for instance, sending me a text wishing me good luck if she knows that I have an important presentation at work, or planning a fun activity when I return home for the holidays.

When I entered therapy seven years ago (to help address some reckless behaviors in my life (*chasing women, struggles focusing at work, poor financial choices*), a therapist said something that has very much stuck with me: **""Your mother tried her best, but she didn't give you the love that you needed.""** 

It's strange and confusing feelings these mixed feelings about a mother who \*did\* so many nice things; when I run into her coworkers in our hometown, they'll inevitably rave about something really nice that she did for the office (baked cookies, stayed late to clean up, etc.).

Has anyone else experienced similar things with their parents? Lots of loving actions on the surface, and not even outright hostility (I'm aware that many parents sadly are extremely critical of so many of you on here), but something different. 

It's hard for me to grasp how I still feel a large amount of sadness about a childhood with a mother who otherwise did and continues to do many loving actions, but who nonetheless failed to soothe when I was upset while also expecting a very high level of fondness from me?",9634,Help Seeking,17:09:31

*I got them all...!*

I'm a huge PasuPale stan and Aya is my best girl, so this was my Re:Zero event. I've been waiting for this event since it first debuted on JP a year ago, and I was prepared to drop absolutely silly money on it if I had to. I've been saving since the June Bride event - I was trying to save before, but... Bride Eve happened - so I had a small stash of 24,000 stars I didn't think was enough and was prepared to spend more. But I still had 5,000 stars left of my original stash when I got my last event card! They even showed up in the perfect order - Hina first, then Chisato, then Aya, so I didn't have to debate on whether or not to continue pulling for Chisato even though I'd technically got what I came for. My luck this time has been *unbelievable*.

God, this event is adorable, too. I'm so psyched, it was well worth the wait.

Good luck to everyone else who's pulling! May you be blessed with your best girl.

I suppose that this is what you get in 2000 for being the world's sole superpower. I'm aware that this might have eventually hurt the U.S. economy. And I'm aware that, given the militaries involved, nuclear womens could get involved.

But given that the U.S. was directly threatened (although they might have felt obliged to help India if China attacked India), do you feel like this episode is emblematic of a country that wastes way too much time worrying what's going on in the rest of the world, when there's so much work that needs to be done in its own country?

Im so broke and have so much debt from gambling that its kinda forcing me to not play.

I played almost immediately. Won over $5k and gave them back probably over 10k I didnt have. So I excluded again. Now Im fighting the other online casino ads and urges to not play.

2020-08-14,unrealistic actions and plot points (of a smaller scale) that you find amusing,"I'm not referring to the major dramatic moments in the show (Zoey's kidnapping, the shooting, Mrs. Landingham's death, Leo's heart attack, etc.)

but are there any moments in the show that you find unlikely or unrealistic but likely occurred to make an episode more entertaining?

one thing where I first noticed this: '20 Hours in Los Angeles'. 

I could be wrong, but it seems quite unlikely to me that someone with Donna's job would have been invited on a fundraising trip.

and if it is likely, then why weren't the assistants of Toby, Sam, or C.J. invited along?",9634,None,04:39:44
2020-08-14,does anyone else wish that we had gotten to know Sam better?,"from what I understand, the show was originally supposed to focus on Rob Lowe's Sam character. The opening scene, remember, wasn't in the office. It was in a bar with Sam talking to a reporter that we would never see again. Given how the show evolved, it's interesting that this is how the show began.

I think of the scenes when Toby goes to Andy's house, or when people visit Toby in his apartmentin s7, or when Charlie visits Zoey's dorm, or the multiple occasions when Amy and Josh hangout at his apartment, or when Danny hangs out at C.J.'s apartment, or the CJ Ohio episode, or the Bartles' fascinating conversations in the residence, etc.

so does anyone else wish that we had spent more time with Sam outside of the office, especially after the beginning of the first season? does anyone have any theories as to why Rob Lowe received less and less screen time, especially seemingly during the 3rd season?",9634,None,05:16:40

2020-08-25,"26, 15k in debt and struggling to move forward...","Hey everyone, it's been 3 days since I've gambled and I just thought I'd open up and share my story and get some advice on moving forward. 

I'm 26 and have been hooked on gambling since I was 20. It started with roullete at the casino. My friend taught me to play and we won a bit of money. It felt great winning, but I remember enjoying the action and excitement more so than walking away with more money. Things started to go downhill once I started betting on sports and horse/dog racing on my own.   Now that I was betting by myself in secret, I would also make trips to the casino by myself to play roulette and other games. When the losses started to get bigger, I began borrowing money from pay day lenders so I could pay my bills and continue to hide my habit.
So that's how it began 6 years ago... and slowly but surely the losses got bigger due to having to bet bigger amounts to feel the excitement and risk, and because I was I losing more and more and wanted to get it back. Fast forward to now and I've lost approximately 70k gambling, and am currently 15k in debt. 

The part I'm really struggling with right now is that I could have completely paid off my debt in one hit, but gambled and lost the money instead. I've never lost this amount in such a short period of time either... Long story short, I live in Australia and lost my job due to covid back in March, and have been on unemployment since. The goverment over here allowed people affected by covid to access our retirement money early (we call it super annuation). I took out 10k in April and blew it, and took another 5k out in July and did the same thing... These losses are substantially bigger than ever before, and I'm having a bit of a tough time forgiving myself for this one. My girlfriend and best friend are the only people I have opened up to about my problem, but they don't know exactly how much I've lost or that I am in debt, but they know I have a problem with it.

What advice do you guys have for moving past gambling, but are still feeling the weight of the addiction because of the debt? Any other advice will be much appreciated also. 

Thank you",373,Problem Gambling,02:10:01

2020-08-25,,"I got kicked out once from my girl. But I refused to go anywhere but my car. She eventually felt bad and let me sleep on couch. We have a son. Who was 2 at the time. Shes told me she hated me, what a loser I was, that she wished our boy wasnt mine, that Im a terrribke father. You name it. She was so sick of me gambling again and again she didnt know what else to do. I had lost rent. And then she forgave and I did it again the next month. After years of seclusion and lying. I came clean and I was then good for a couple of months. Until I relapsed. But deep down as much as she hated me she still loved me and weve worked really hard to work through it. Now its only been a month or so for me but things are looking up. Were getting along, slowly finding that spark again and were even having sex. Which for a long, long time didnt happen. She wanted nothing to do with me in me worse. So there is hope. Shell come around if she truly loves you. When you get so locked into it, its almost uncontrollable. Youre not you. And thats the disease. You need to ban yourself from any and all online. You need to ban physical casino if its open and you go, and you need a plan on how youre going to pay bills.

2020-08-27,,"I would suggest writing down all the reasons you decided to stop gambling in the first place, and try to think of specific negative memories associated with those reasons. Now that you are gambling again, your brain is very good at tricking you into forgetting about or downplaying all the negative aspects of your addiction (I'm sure there's many). 

As your addiction has grown over time, your brain has changed. There are now certain thought patterns and neurological pathways embedded in there due to the addiction. Your brain knows you're gambling again, and all those pathways are already set up and ready to go... that is why it feels so hard to stop. Your brain hasn't felt this in months so it's doing all it can to get that dopamine. Don't feed it.

Reflect on the thoughts that led up to the relapse. Those pathways activate long before you make the decision to deposit money to gamble. They usually begin when you say ""Hmm maybe I could gamble a little bit and be responsible"". It's the addictions way of tricking you just so it can get its fuel.

Recognise those early cries for fuel, and it should be easier to say ""No, my brain is trying trick me to go back to this addiction just so it can get it's fix""

Best wishes, and I hope this makes sense.",373,Problem Gambling,11:54:18

It's so important to have an understanding of how gambling plays on your mind, as well as knowing your own personal triggers. Having this knowledge about your own personal gambling habits is such a powerful tool. For me, it's not only allowed me to learn a heap about my gambling addiction, but I've learnt so much about myself too.... Not sure if it's the same for you but I feel like this is such a key step on regaining control over your addicted mind.

It seems like you have really thought deeply about this, and have made some huge steps this year because of it! Huge congratulations to you... you are on the right track! Keep learning more about the addiction and yourself. Knowledge and community are key.

Gambling addiction has a way of creating some bad money habits and routines... In my experience, I felt like gambling really ended up altering the way I valued money. Getting back to the rational thoughts are tough, but accepting the situation for what it is, and addressing things as soon as possible is honestly the best way. 

Also, I've tried the whole gambling budget thing... for me it didn't work, and I don't think it works for any gambling addict to be honest. It would always start off okay, then I'd eventually start telling myself ""Oh, well that person bought me lunch, so there's an extra $30 I can spend"".

2020-09-07,"Lost my future in a week, need some support","Hi everyone

I've been reading some reddits over here all day and I just wanted to share my story hoping that you can help me a bit getting my mind clear.

So I am a 26 year old guy who started first gambling at 18 and got addicted after a first big win quite soon. When I was 18 I first won 5k but afterwards lost it all and kept on depositing money while chasing losses. Eventually I got into debt and was busy paying that off for years while living on 30 bucks a week.

4 years ago I finally paid off my debt and in the meantime besides working I was building some websites and one became a big succes, I was able to sell it for 900k and after paying taxes and stuff I had about 450k.

In the meantime I spent a lot of that money and last year I also got lost in gambling again playing live blackjack online and losing 100k in a day or so. I felt so sick of that and thought I would never gamble again, what kind of idiot loses 100k??? Could have done so much with that money.

Now this year gambling sneaked up on me again and I told myself I could keep it under control. However last friday until wednesday I lost control. At first I won something like 30k with a 4k deposit, but I could not stop and lost that all. I kept depositing money until I was down 90k and then gambled all the way up to 100k. I was telling myself I should stop but yet I couldnt and then lost it all. Next day I woke up and said I never do it again, yet 1 hour later there I went and I lost even more.

It kept on going like this until wednesday where I reached the point that I couldnt reach any more money as my remaining assets were frozen. So in in total I lost 200k in a few days plus another 100k last year, this is just so much money and I feel so so stupid and unresponsible, yet I can't help it because when I am in the rush I keep on depositing and don't see the value of money anymore.

From all the money I made I only have 140k left after selling all my assets and I intend to invest 125k of that in a holiday home so that the money is locked up. However the holiday home is 260k in total so now I am so mad that with all I lost I could have bought that appartment mortgage-free AND pay off part of my mortgage on my first home as well. Instead now I'm only making a downpayment and have to worry about if I can afford the second mortgage if the appartment doesn't rent out as well as expected.

I keep on thinking about what I've lost and what I could have done with all that money, as well as that's mission impossible to earn so much money again... 

From now on I intend not to gamble anymore, not even the smallest amount. But I can't help the angry and guilty feeling on what I've done to myself and how I destroyed my stress-free future.

Please help me to see clear and to stay positive because I feel really really bad since I stopped gambling last wednesday.",4281,Problem Gambling,17:40:09

2020-09-12,,"It's tough to get out of the mindset... I'm going through a similiar situation right now with the NBA and now NFL too. Been about 3 weeks now since I've bet.. I just keep reminding myself that it's not worth going through the stress and worry that will inevitably come if I put on a bet. If I win, so what... I'll only lose it plus more eventually. Not worth it one bit. 

At the end of the day, sport is just sport... sometimes crazy shit happens, sometimes it doesn't. Just sit back and enjoy it for what it is, stress free.

If you have ideations, not a precise plan but want to discuss the principle behind your reasoning, a therapist is not supposed to call the authorities on you. 

That being said, regardless of life's circumstances, wanting to end your life is not a biologically normal reaction; we are made to want to survive and to live. When you reach a point where you lose that will to live, it's usually a result of mental hardships or illness. I wish you manage to realize feeling the way you do is not normal, and is not permanent. Death, however, is.

2020-09-18,,"Man, don't do it.

I had around 400k in my bank account less than a month ago. I lost 80k on one day and thought it couldnt get worse, yet in the days after I lost another 100k, 10k, 30k and after swearing AGAIN I would not gamble anymore I lost another 12k 2 days ago. Oh, and last year I also lost 100k.

I estimate my total loss around 500k of which this year only around 250k. From the last bit of money I have left (140k) I am spending almost everything (125k) on a downpayment for a second home which I also need to mortgage now for 150k.

I should have been either a millionaire by now or at least have 3/4 houses and enjoy rental income. Now I lost nearly everything on gambling and all I got is 3k on my bank, 20k in crypto/stocks and a second home of which hopefully the rental income is just enough to cover the mortgage.

Keep your 10k and start rebuilding your life. Even if you gamble with if and you win, you will lose it eventually because it's never enough. And even if you turn the 10k into 20k and then attempt to stop, it will still feel as a loss because you lost yourself in terms of self control.

2020-09-18,Therapy and Gambling Addiction. How did it help you?,"Was just curious about 1 on 1 therapy to help treat a gambling addiction... I'm doing a tonne of research and am committed to treating my addiction properly, and it seems that therapy is the next logical step for me personally. 

What has everyone's experience been with going to a therapist? And how soon into your recovery did you start going?

One more question...Is there such thing as a therapist that specialises in gambling addiction? Half of me thinks that picking any therapist will do because I know it would be helpful regardless of my addiction... but seeing a catered therapist could be beneficial to really help connect the dots properly right? Maybe I'm just afraid that this is still seen as taboo and I wont be understood or treated properly... Is this where GA can fill that gap, or am I being too harsh on these therapists lol.

Here's the only 3 scenarios in your situation.

1) Lose the 10k too
2) Win and feed the addiction even more. This will quickly become a 'future loss' and you'll end up at Scenario 1

2020-09-25,,"So, I'm an atheist, and an addiction therapist. One thing that is prevalent in drug addiction treatment based on the 12 steps program, is the recognition of a higher power. I'll tell you why I believe it is useful, why science accepts it as a useful in recovery, and what it means exactly to me.

I believe it's useful to believe in a higher power in order to stop focusing on our own self, in order to stop centering the universe on us. When you believe in something greater than you, be it a god, nature, the needs of the many, the universe - as long as you recognize you aren't the only and most important thing in existance. When you believe in something greater than you, it puts things into perspective.

The need for a belief in a higher power does not prescribe religion. Your therapist shared with you how religion helped them. Good for them - religion helped a lot of people to see beyond their own self. But it's not for everyone. 

My higher power is reason, logic, or the laws of physics. No matter what I think, no matter how I feel, those never change, and I should rely on them at all times. I chose that as a higher power because it works for me.

Find whatever works for you. Your therapist isn't wrong in wanting you to adopt a higher power, but it is wrong to suggest a higher power for you to adopt. Only you can choose that.

Also, higher power is a great thing and all, but it's only one of the things that help. Beliefs alone won't fix everything - gotta work on yourself a lot too.

2020-09-25,,"I'm honestly asking you - does it matter so much to know the reason why you like it?

Why do you like the foods you like? Why do you enjoy the things you enjoy? 

I could suggest that it's because your arousal doesn't really go down, or because you're turned on by the denial aspect of it. 

In the end, does it affect negatively your life? If it does not, no harm done. If it does, then you'll need to address it, but I promise there is nothing so weird or abnormal about you. Sexuality is fucking weird, and it's all good.",9911,None,07:11:05

What psilocybin does is allow you to process thoughts and information in ways which are not usual for your brain (new neural connections can be made). But it doesn't erase what's there. 

It can be very useful if used in the right context. Those studies you talk about are talking about a single dose, taken in a therapeutic context ideally with a therapeutic guide of sorts. You also have to WANT the experience to change you.

Wanting to suicide, to end your life, goes against all instinct of survival. We didnt evolve to become suicidal; in fact the drive behind the will to be alive is common to most living things on Earth. Why would you feel that way, then, if it goes against our nature?

Simply because, and its a simplified explanation, but it has to be because there is something wrong going on. Depression, brain chemical imbalance, or another problem could bring you to the point of being convinced death is the answer. 

But all problems have solutions. Get the medical help you need to survive until you can get appropriate help with the issue which made you suicidal. Thats in my opinion as a therapist, the best reason to go to the ER. If you had a cancerous growth you would seek medical help. If you had a broken arm you would also seek medical help. Now you have suicidal ideas; seek medical help.",9911,None,04:28:57
2020-10-07,,"Society is a construct. Not natural. Society doesn't dictate how we function biologically.

What about people who once wanted to end things and instead got help and are now doing better? What about people who attempted suicide, failed, and got to therapy and now are doing much better?

About where it is; I don't know where you live. I don't know what kind of healthcare you have access to. But the professionals at the ER do. 

It's not about if there is help that exists or not. It's about whether you will give up before you even try. And remember your brain will try all kinds of tricks to make you believe that there is no hope. It's a ""bug"", just gotta get someone to help you ""debug"" your brain.

2020-10-07,Day 1,"It all started 3 months ago when my friend introduce me to sports betting where he paid for picks and I thought it was a good winning percentage and he would give me the picks they sent him every day for free. Eventually I would just bet on my own accord since I didn't think their picks were that good. I will gamble on anything including sports- today is the day I am try to quit. I've lost my savings which was not much but it made me take out loans that I am still paying for. I had 2.5k in savings which now is gone. and -$1500 in credit card debt, and on top of that I have a loan that takes money out of my paycheck every two weeks. I hope by posting here I can actually stop thinking/obsessing about gambling every second of my life. It doesn't help that I have an addictive personality as well. I actually just put my last 30$ I had on a online gambling website in a parlay. I hope I lose so I don't have to think about betting more. I gamble because of boredom and the feeling of winning is such a high I'm also a weed smoker which doesn't help.

2020-10-10,,"Hi....Im addicted to slot machines as well. Ive been addicted to them for about 13 years. Youre story caught my eye because you talk about setting a limit but that limit turns into 10x that in a course of a night. I remember 13 years ago when I used to say Im only going to spend $60. Then that 60 became a 100, and as you start making more money in your career that base number increases as well. So the 100 became 200, then 300 and for many years it remained 300 strictly on my weekend, then that 300 became a couple times a week, then every night. Then that 300 became 500...then if Im chasing 1500....if Im having a really bad night 3000. This constant increasing of your tolerance doesnt happen over night, but I can definitely see an upward trend and I assure you it doesnt end well...unless you hit like megabucks....but even that we still have a problem and as long as that underlying problem is still there youre tolerance will just increase and you will only be able to stop when you have zero or in my case lots of credit card debt ...so actually below zero or until you address the problem. The problem is once youve crossed that line of this is fun to I need to do this to get losses back, you will always be gambling to get losses back. Sure many times it will be fun, but in the back of your mind youre trying to get back the 500 you lost last night and even if you do get back that 500, you dont stop cause now that you did that you think you can get back the 1000 you lost the week before and even if you somehow very luckily do that then you try to get back what you lost last month. Even if you forget about your losses which I do all the time, you do it again thinking Ive cut my losses theres nothing to chase, but a gambler always chases, may not be every session but the chase is always just around the corner. I truly think at least for me Im not actually chasing money, Im chasing something that I feel is missing in my life. By the way I quit 8 days ago...I cant begin to tell you how to quit without reaching extremes, just wanted to tell you how the progression of gambling works...and I  hope this helps you understand a little bit of how your future is more than likely going to look like.hope you can get better.",6800,Problem Gambling,05:55:10
2020-10-10,,"I have felt this way many times. When I first started gambling I absolutely hated that the outcome of my night out whether it was fun or horrible strictly depended upon whether I won or lost gambling. Over time gambling became like a job, sometimes I liked it and sometimes I hated it but I was compelled to go and this job payed horrible wages by the way. I also drank heavily when I was gambling, I think it was to numb the pain of losing. ( funny note: I had a friend drag me to AA because she thought I had a drinking problem, no it was a consequence to my actual problem)And then I realized that the stakes were not whether or not I had fun that night...now I am gambling with my mental stability... and on really desperate nights I felt like I was gambling with life and death. I work in the gaming industry so I see it first hand how unforgiving this addiction is, the sad part is I participate in it as well. Ive gambled just about every game you can gamble on. Ive did have a problem with sports betting as well. Crazy how you can know absolutely nothing about a sport, but put some money on it and you can be a professional referee. Anyways...Im trying to stop gambling, and I hope you do too...I wouldnt wish this addiction on my worst enemy.  Well truth is..

2020-10-10,My thoughts on: Im really quitting this time,"So I just quit gambling last week. Ive gambled for over a decade.

I did play online poker when it was really popular when Chris moneymaker won ( lol that last name makes me laugh every time I hear it) I think it was his last name that got more people hooked than just the thought of an amateur winning the World Series of poker...anyways sorry I get off topic a lot. Most of my gambling career as I like to call it because it became like a second job was slots more specifically video poker and keno. I have tried to quit many times : this is the last time I swear my New Years resolution is to quit gambling and lose weight lol you guys no the drill. Ive always been open about my gambling problem because I truly believe that the majority of us are fighting some kind of battle, and I dont really care if people judge me. I amzzz who i am.

The truth is many of us are addicts whether it be gambling, alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, food, video games, porn, binge watching Netflix. Ive learned that you cant blame the environment in which your addiction takes place, but you do have the choice to remove yourself from that environment. Like I said I work in the gaming industry and have seen many gambling addicts but I also see many people who are not. If we eat McDonalds every day and get super unhealthy we dont blame McDonalds and their employees. But I understand how you feel, its easy to look at all the things that went wrong and what couldve contributed but its not always easy to accept responsibility that ultimately you had a choice but the addiction was just too powerful for you to make a good one.  And yes you may feel like gambling addiction is the worst one but maybe put yourself in the shoes of an alcoholic, who maybe needs a new liver and has a set amount of time left to live.

2020-10-10,,"I am a compulsive gambler, and my husband hates gambling. I honestly think he has a bigger problem than I do. I live with a gambling addiction. He lives with a gambling addict. You know that saying its not fun when youre the only sober one at the party. Over the many years of my gambling his reaction to me has changed dramatically.
1. Our finances were separate... lots of dont tell me what to do with my money 
2. Got married...combined our finances...lots of i make money too
3. Spent way more than my fair share...lots of hiding my gambling losses ( I did the finances.... mistake number 1)
4. Coming clean about my losses..... he bails me out with a second mortgage 
5. Still gambling ....he tries to put me on a budget and takes all my credit cards
6. Orders more credit cards behind his back... lots of shame 
7. Trying to manage my problem on my own...tried to super glue cut up credit cards back together while chasing and thats after digging through the trash to find them! 
8. Coming clean again, while understanding that if he left I would be sad for me but happy for him....reaching out for help this time around 


Anyways moral of the story: if you bail him out, you are an enabler. After he quit enabling me, never once did he turn his back on me emotionally. And I respect and appreciate that so much. But I know that yes you can stop giving me money, you can beg, you can yell but its going to take my own desire to quit.

2. Start out gambling real small denominations ( mostly video poker and keno)
3. Start to lose those small amounts of money 
4. Want a shot of jack Daniels and a cigarette 
5. Start to feel loose and start to lose at the same time 
6. start losing more ....increase my denomination
7. Lose a bunch of money
8. Now I need like 4 shots and a pack of cigarettes 
9. Find more money (usually cash advances)
10. Lose that 
11. Leave the casino or bar...very hungry at this point
12. Go to McDonalds...look for as much loose change i can find in my car to pay for this food
13. Go home 
14. Wake up super hungover, broke, and no motivation to go to the gym 
15. Recover on this day 
16. Wash, rinse, repeat 
17. Fast forward 3-4 months and boom ... hello 50 pounds 
18. Go on a crazy diet, stay clean, 3-4 months later goodbye 50 pounds...hello casino",6800,Recovery,15:18:42
2020-10-10,,"I too was gambling heavily when I was in college. I distinctly remember having 4K in credit card debt and that was all from gambling this does not include my tuition. I remember thinking if I just hit a dollar royal (4K) I will erase this problem. Guess what? I hit that royal and paid off my credit card. Sounds great right...I thought I had closed the book on that lifestyle....I was dead wrong...that was only the introduction into this book. Once I got that jackpot....I celebrated being debt free and carrying on with my life for about 2 weeks. Then thoughts started to creep in my head... if I can turn this hundred into lets say 4K I can use it for my tuition. That hundred and thought process cause me to go into even deeper debt ( much deeper...like 35k in credit card debt twice, several 401k loans, a second mortgage and not to mention all the extra money I had left after bills were paid) So no matter if youre winning or losing it doesnt really matter unless you fix the problems you have and maybe the problems that are causing you to gamble. Because if you dont fix those problems you will always find a reason to gamble. Also, please do not commit suicide...its a shame this addiction has caused so many suicidal thoughts.  I joke around alot about my addiction because it makes me feel a little better to laugh about it. But all jokes aside, yes this addiction will win your money and at times your sanity, but dont let it win your life ( speaking from experience, Ive had suicidal thoughts and attempted it once then immediately regretted it, grateful I didnt succeed and grateful Im still here fighting for the only life I have, fighting for good days and in bad days knowing they will pass) and grateful I can still wake up to the most handsome, smartest, and loving dog in the world :) hope this helps...wish you happiness",6800,Problem Gambling,16:06:02

6. If I win then it doesnt count as a relapse 
7. I dont want to quit a loser

2020-10-14,Work is Awful,"Work is absolutely terrible.

I hate it so much. My job is work from home and I'm still miserable. I could never go back to an office. I try to do all sorts of other stuff while doing my job but it's still torture. The days are damn long and I couldn't give a single shit about anyone who wants and feels entitled to my help. My irritation and anger level is off the charts and it stays there all fucking day. I'm supposed to just accept this shit, but I can't.

Fuck corporate America. It's clear they couldn't give any less of a shit about employees. They pay you half what you really should get and use and abuse you for your labor. Labor is used for profit, that's all it is, the people who profit are the ones up top. It's purely exploitation. How little can we pay them to make them have to keep coming back tomorrow? This is all about using people at the bottom to make the wealthy richer who don't want to share any of it. I can't even contain how bored and utterly crushed my soul is from doing this the last 5 years. I'm not even 30 yet.

My attitude is terrible and I can't help it. Sick and tired of slaving away to benefit other people. 8 hours a day, everyday. Thankless, mindless, soul crushing work. The economy is in the toilet and they rig the stock market right back to where it was 4 months later as if nothing ever happened. The wealthy can't ever lose in our country. Everything works out just fine for them, every time. I'm convinced the true wealthy class ruins life for everyone else. All this productivity which is stripped away from the average worker funnels straight to them.

I knew it was going to happen someday. Just had to tell my husband, who's been bearing this all impossibly well, that I couldn't have sex because I'm flaring up, had been asleep for something like fourteen hours of the last twenty-four, and simply didn't have the energy for it.

I feel like a shit partner for not trying anyway, because what else am I using what little energy I have for? I feel angry with him for trying to push it in the first place when he knows I've been awake today to eat and shower and that's it. I'm worried he'll get tired of medication and exhaustion combining to send my sex drive into a 100-year sleep all of it's own, and leave me for someone slimmer and healthier who can actually go to work and contribute to the household and go to bed with him. I feel sad and scared and mad and I dont know what to do with any of these feelings or who I'm supposed to talk to. Am I even allowed to post about this here?

mid-30s. single. lonely. in a town without many friends. boring career stuck in neutral. 100 pounds overweight after a decade of unhealthy eating to numb loneliness.

will be a tight few months financially paying off bookies, but I'll survive.

my main thought today is that life seems so boring without the excitement of seeing if my sports bet wins.

I'm aware intellectually that I am incapable of gambling in a responsible manner, but I'm having a hard time acknowledging that reality emotionally.

I had an 18-minute phone call this morning with a guy from last night's meeting. he has 20 years sober.

Making excuses as to why I was so broke. I was doing so good. It even got to the point where I wasnt thinking about it much. Here and there but I kept telling myself no. I was so proud! Until last night. I had this urge I just couldnt shake. I even asked my girlfriend if shed sign into her play now account and let me just spend $50.(I banned myself from mine) she of course said no. Because she knows me too well. Well I have an account with a UK online captain cooks casino. And I thought fuck Ill go have a shower and just check the site, see the promos. Sure even there is a 100% match promo and a bonus $25 promo just for depositing. So I decided to just put in $50 like I wanted to. I lost that almost immediately. Then I thought just $50 more and Ill stop. Well that $50 took me to $360 back down to $200 then up to $800. I was so excited. And I could really use the cash. So I cashed out thinking Im up $700 and lifes good. I thought to myself Ill go tell my gf shell be a little annoyed I played but happy its a positive result and Ill wait my 2 days and get my money. Well instead I sneak fully kept playing the winnings. She went upstairs to put our son to bed and I continued with nothing, absolutely nothing but loss. Once the $800 was gone I should of stopped and just been upset at my stupidity. Nope! I deposit $50 more, straight loss. I end up stuck on this app like crack for the next couple hrs. Most I hit was $100 which I would just piss away chasing more. Long story short I lost $950 of my own money and $800 winnings with a total loss of $1750. I was up all night tossing n turning with guilt and shame. Fuck gambling really is the devil. I dont know how this will ever leave my life for good. I finally was catching up on bills, made a tiny dent in my credit cards, which is gone now. Im apprenticing plumbing and Im really trying to change my life for my family. Ive been working my ass off 6 days a week. Was doing 10hr days the last two months. And i got nothing to show for it. $200 left in the bank and 11 days until payday. Fml. One thing that helped me a lot with stopping for the few months I did was reading all your stories. So hopefully my stupid one will inspire you to stop.",7761,Motivated,06:04:15

I would say she is slightly weaker but so small shes basically the same, and the fact you can build her tankier and kill tanks easier is kind of better.
